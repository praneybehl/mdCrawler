# Local RAG agent with LLaMA3¶
We'll combine ideas from paper RAG papers into a RAG agent:
  * **Routing:** Adaptive RAG (paper). Route questions to different retrieval approaches
  * **Fallback:** Corrective RAG (paper). Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query
  * **Self-correction:** Self-RAG (paper). Fix answers w/ hallucinations or don’t address question

## Local models¶
### Embedding¶
GPT4All Embeddings:
```
pip install langchain-nomic

```

### LLM¶
Use Ollama and llama3.2:
```
ollama pull llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16 

```

```
### LLM
fromlangchain_ollamaimport ChatOllama

local_llm = "llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16"
llm = ChatOllama(model=local_llm, temperature=0)
llm_json_mode = ChatOllama(model=local_llm, temperature=0, format="json")

```

API Reference: ChatOllama
### Search¶
For search, we use Tavily, which is a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG.
```

def_set_env(var: str):
  if not os.environ.get(var):
    os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")
os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "true"

```

### Tracing¶
Optionally, use LangSmith for tracing. 
```
_set_env("LANGSMITH_API_KEY")
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "local-llama32-rag"

```

```
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique used in natural language processing to generate human-like responses by iteratively asking questions and refining the search space through external search queries, such as Wikipedia APIs. CoT prompting involves decomposing problems into multiple thought steps, generating multiple thoughts per step, and evaluating each state using a classifier or majority vote. The goal is to find an optimal instruction that leads to the desired output, which can be achieved by optimizing prompt parameters directly on the embedding space via gradient descent or searching over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates.

```

Score:

A score of yes means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria. This is the highest (best) score. 

A score of no means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria. This is the lowest possible score you can give.

# Graph¶
We build the above workflow as a graph using LangGraph.
### Graph state¶
The graph `state` schema contains keys that we want to:
  * Pass to each node in our graph
  * Optionally, modify in each node of our graph 


See conceptual docs here.
```
importoperator
fromtyping_extensionsimport TypedDict
fromtypingimport List, Annotated


classGraphState(TypedDict):
"""
  Graph state is a dictionary that contains information we want to propagate to, and modify in, each graph node.
  """

  generation: str # LLM generation

  max_retries: int # Max number of retries for answer generation
  answers: int # Number of answers generated
  loop_step: Annotated[int, operator.add]
  documents: List[str] # List of retrieved documents

```

Each node in our graph is simply a function that:
(1) Take `state` as an input
(2) Modifies `state`
(3) Write the modified `state` to the state schema (dict)
See conceptual docs here.
Each edge routes between nodes in the graph.
