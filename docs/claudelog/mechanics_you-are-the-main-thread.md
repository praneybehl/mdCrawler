With the introduction of AI agents the opportunity cost of your time has gone up N fold.
Before AI agents, being 'unproductive' meant wasting just your own time in a simple opportunity cost equation: `opportunity cost × 1`.
But AI agents change the math entirely. Every idle moment now represents not just your 'wasted' time, but all the parallel processes you could have initiated. The opportunity cost is magnified: `(opportunity cost × 1) + (opportunity cost × N)`.
I find myself asking the question:
> What asynchronous process could I have running in the background that could be delivering value?
Hmm... a new world of possibilities, all I can say for certain is do not block the main thread.
##### Don't block the main thread!
Think like a CPU scheduler - queue up tasks, context switch efficiently, and never let your cores idle. Your attention is the bottleneck. `Spawn processes, delegate operations, watch throughput explode.`
