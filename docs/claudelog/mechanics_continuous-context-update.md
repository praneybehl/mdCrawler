One habit I take for granted when utilising Claude Code is how I continuously update the context. As you develop systems, overcome challenges, perform research you `must` update the corresponding `Claude.md` (project-wide instructions and context), create `feature.md` files (specific functionality documentation) or create module specific `Claude.md` files (targeted guidance for subsystems).
### Don't just Clear the Context Window​
The absolute no-no is clearing or compacting your context before you ask Claude to strategically update your `Claude.md` files or build feature specific `.md` files which could be used to debug functionality in the future.
Particularly I ask Claude to document `quirks which could be important to know in the future when a human or himself needs to debug a piece of functionality`.
### Implementation Strategy​
### During Development​
  * **Document quirks** - Note unusual behaviors or edge cases
  * **Record solutions** - Keep track of what worked and what didn't
  * **Update patterns** - Evolve your approaches based on learnings
  * **Preserve context** - Don't prematurely clear valuable session information


### What to Document​
  * **Debugging insights** - Solutions to problems you encountered
  * **System quirks** - Unexpected behaviors or requirements
  * **Integration challenges** - How different parts work together
  * **Performance considerations** - What affects speed or efficiency
  * **Configuration gotchas** - Settings that cause issues


### The Future Self Investment​
By maintaining continuous context updates, you're investing in faster debugging as solutions are already documented, better consistency with patterns preserved across sessions, knowledge retention where important insights don't get lost, and improved collaboration where others can understand your system quickly.
##### Knowledge Investment
Continuous context updating is like compound interest for AI collaboration. Every documented quirk and solution today saves hours of debugging tomorrow. Treat your `Claude.md` as institutional memory.
