ClaudeLog is a comprehensive documentation website for Claude Code featuring experiments, insights, and mechanics from real-world usage. I created this resource as a Reddit moderator collecting community insights to help developers maximize their Claude Code productivity through proven techniques and best practices.
### How ClaudeLog Works​
**Community-Driven Research** - I actively moderate r/ClaudeAI and collect insights from the Claude Code community, analyzing real user questions and challenges to create practical documentation.
**Real-World Testing** - Each mechanic and technique documented here comes from actual development work, including testing Claude Code's reliability with novel frameworks and bespoke systems at Command Stick™.
**Practical Documentation** - Rather than theoretical advice, ClaudeLog provides actionable techniques you can implement immediately, from CLAUDE.md optimization to workflow automation.

Begin with CLAUDE.md Supremacy and You Are the Main Thread for foundational Claude Code understanding.
Regular Updates
ClaudeLog is updated multiple times a week with new mechanics, FAQ entries, and community insights based on the latest Claude Code developments.
##### Community-Driven Documentation
ClaudeLog transforms Reddit insights and real-world testing into actionable Claude Code mechanics. Every technique documented here comes from actual development work and community validation.
