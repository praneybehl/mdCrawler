For new users on Windows, I recommend starting with VS Code integration. You get Claude Code's power with the familiar editor interface, making the learning curve much gentler.
### VS Code Integration (Recommended for Beginners)​
I observe that beginners have much more success with the VS Code approach. You run Claude Code in VS Code's integrated terminal while editing files in the familiar interface.
**Why it works better for newcomers:**
  * **Familiar environment** : Keep using VS Code shortcuts and features you already know
  * **Visual file changes** : See Claude's edits immediately in the editor with syntax highlighting
  * **Visual Git integration** : VS Code's diff viewer, staging interface, and commit tools provide a familiar visual experience for reviewing Claude's changes
  * **WSL integration** : VS Code's Remote-WSL extension provides smooth integration between Windows and the Linux environment


The setup is straightforward: open VS Code, open the integrated terminal, run `claude`, and start coding. Claude makes changes that appear instantly in your editor. See our Windows installation guide and VS Code integration for detailed setup instructions.
### Terminal Approach​
Terminal mode is excellent once you're comfortable with command-line workflows. I switch to terminal when doing bulk file operations, when I want to focus purely on the conversation without editor distractions, or when I just want to `lock-in` with a minimal lightweight UI.
**When terminal excels:**
  * **Focus mode** : Minimal UI when you want to `lock-in` without distractions
  * **Quick tasks** : File renames, bulk operations, project analysis, MCP tasks, queries, research
  * **Command-line familiarity** : Great for users comfortable with CLI workflows
  * **Performance** : Slightly faster on resource-constrained systems


Start with VS Code
Begin with VS Code integration to build confidence with Claude Code. Once comfortable, experiment with terminal workflows - they're excellent but have a learning curve. Many experienced users end up using both approaches strategically.
##### Learning Curve Strategy
Beginners experience higher success rates with VS Code's familiar interface and visual git tools. Terminal mode becomes powerful once comfortable with CLI workflows and focus-oriented development.
