Claude Code includes a built-in todo list system accessible through TodoRead and TodoWrite tools. Todo lists help track progress and show what Claude plans to do next during your coding session.
### How Todo Lists Work​
Claude Code automatically creates and updates todo lists as you work on tasks. Todo items have three states: pending (not started), in_progress (currently working), and completed (finished).
### Why Use Todo Lists​
Todo lists provide visibility into Claude's work plan and let you see progress in real-time. They're especially useful for complex tasks with multiple steps, helping ensure nothing gets missed. You can request more detailed or broader todo items depending on your preference for granular control.
**Simple Example:**
When you ask Claude to "add a contact form to the website," the todo list might show:
  * Create contact form component
  * Add form validation
  * Style the form
  * Test form submission
  * Update navigation to include contact page


This gives you a clear picture of what's planned and lets you modify the approach if needed.
tip
Todo lists give you transparency into Claude's work plan and help track progress on multi-step tasks.
##### Task Progress Visibility
Todo lists reveal Claude's interpretation of your instructions and enable mid-task steering. Use todo states to track progress and modify complex multi-step development workflows.
