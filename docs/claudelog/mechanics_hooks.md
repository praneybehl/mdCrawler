Hooks are a new mechanic introduced to Claude Code to allow deterministic responses based on a given event such as tool executions, file changes, or deployment activities.
### Real-World Implementationâ€‹
I have been experimenting with simple use cases for how they can be used to improve the reliability of my existing workflows such as running various pre/post deploy related activities before deploying the ClaudeLog website live.
When you update a website online there are various SEO related activities which must be performed such as:
  * **Deploying your sitemap** to various web master tools
  * **Checking build process** has not generated invalid JSON schemas (different web masters are surprisingly sensitive)
  * **Validating URLs** are all live and well formed


These were simple low hanging fruit which Claude suggested for me to explore implementing into my workflow based on my existing deployment pipeline.
### The Scoping Challengeâ€‹
Interestingly I found the fiddliest bit was scoping the activation requirements such that they do not activate too early.
### Badly Scoped Hook Exampleâ€‹
```
{"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[{"matcher":"Bash","hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"./scripts/expensive-validation.sh"}]}]}}
```

_This fires on ANY bash command, running expensive validation even for simple`ls` or `pwd` commands_
### Better Scoped Hook Example - Smart Dispatcher Patternâ€‹
```
{"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[{"matcher":"Bash","hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"./scripts/smart-hook-dispatcher.sh"}]}]}}
```

**Smart Dispatcher Script:**
```
#!/bin/bash# Read JSON input from Claude Codejson_input=$(cat)command=$(echo "$json_input" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')# Exit early if no commandif [ -z "$command" ]; then  exit 0fi# Scope to specific commands onlyif echo "$command" | grep -q "npm run deploy"; then  echo "ðŸš€ Running pre-deployment validation..."  ./scripts/pre-deployment-checks.sh <<< "$json_input"fiif echo "$command" | grep -q "npm run build"; then  echo "ðŸ”§ Running build validation..."  ./scripts/build-validator.sh <<< "$json_input"fi
```

_This intelligently routes commands based on content analysis, only running expensive operations when needed_
### Finding Hook Opportunitiesâ€‹
To find suggestions for where hooks could be useful within your setup be sure to ask Claude to review your current systems and suggest the benefit of Hooks.
Just beware that if they're unnecessarily firing you will have an extremely slowed down Agent (thankfully it is not costing you tokens though).
### Available Triggersâ€‹
  * **PreToolUse** - Before tool execution
  * **PostToolUse** - After tool completion
  * **UserPromptSubmit** - When user submits a prompt
  * **Stop** - When Claude Code agent finishes responding


### Best Practicesâ€‹
  * **Smart dispatching** - Use single entry point with intelligent command routing to avoid performance penalties
  * **Exit code checking** - Validate successful command execution in PostToolUse hooks (`.tool_response.exit_code` only available after execution)
  * **Parallel execution** - Run independent validations concurrently with `&` and `wait` for faster processing
  * **JSON input parsing** - Extract command details with `jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty'` (fallback handles missing fields gracefully)
  * **Performance monitoring** - Track hook execution time and cache results to identify bottlenecks
  * **Error handling** - Graceful failure for non-critical hooks prevents workflow interruption
  * **Scope precisely** - Target specific commands rather than broad tool categories to maintain responsiveness


##### Workflow Automation
Hooks transform reactive development into proactive automation. Well-scoped hooks eliminate manual deployment steps and catch issues before they reach production. The key is precise trigger patterns.
