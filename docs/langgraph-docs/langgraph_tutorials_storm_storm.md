# Web Research (STORM)¶
STORM is a research assistant designed by Shao, et. al that extends the idea of "outline-driven RAG" for richer article generation.
STORM is designed to generate Wikipedia-style ariticles on a user-provided topic. It applies two main insights to produce more organized and comprehensive articles:
  1. Creating an outline (planning) by querying similar topics helps improve coverage.
  2. Multi-perspective, grounded (in search) conversation simulation helps increase the reference count and information density. 


The control flow looks like the diagram below.
![storm.png](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/storm/storm/)
STORM has a few main stages:
  1. Generate initial outline + Survey related subjects
  2. Identify distinct perspectives
  3. "Interview subject matter experts" (role-playing LLMs)
  4. Refine outline (using references)
  5. Write sections, then write article


The expert interviews stage occurs between the role-playing article writer and a research expert. The "expert" is able to query external knowledge and respond to pointed questions, saving cited sources to a vectorstore so that the later refinement stages can synthesize the full article.
There are a couple hyperparameters you can set to restrict the (potentially) infinite research breadth:
N: Number of perspectives to survey / use (Steps 2->3) M: Max number of conversation turns in step (Step 3)
## Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain_community langchain_openai langchain_fireworks langgraph wikipedia duckduckgo-search tavily-python

```

```
# Uncomment if you want to draw the pretty graph diagrams.
# If you are on MacOS, you will need to run brew install graphviz before installing and update some environment flags
# ! brew install graphviz
# !CFLAGS="-I $(brew --prefix graphviz)/include" LDFLAGS="-L $(brew --prefix graphviz)/lib" pip install -U pygraphviz

```

```
importgetpass
importos


def_set_env(var: str):
  if os.environ.get(var):
    return
  os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(var + ":")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")

```

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development
Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
### Select LLMs¶
We will have a faster LLM do most of the work, but a slower, long-context model to distill the conversations and write the final report.
```
fromlangchain_openaiimport ChatOpenAI

fast_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
# Uncomment for a Fireworks model
# fast_llm = ChatFireworks(model="accounts/fireworks/models/firefunction-v1", max_tokens=32_000)
long_context_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

```

API Reference: ChatOpenAI
## Generate Initial Outline¶
For many topics, your LLM may have an initial idea of the important and related topics. We can generate an initial outline to be refined after our research. Below, we will use our "fast" llm to generate the outline.
Using Pydantic with LangChain
This notebook uses Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`, which requires `langchain-core >= 0.3`. Using `langchain-core < 0.3` will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 `BaseModels`.

# Impact of million-plus token context window language models on RAG

## Introduction

Brief overview of million-plus token context window language models and RAG.

## Million-Plus Token Context Window Language Models

Explanation of million-plus token context window language models, their architecture, training process, and capabilities.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Explanation of RAG model, its components, and how it combines information retrieval with text generation.

## Impact on RAG

Discussion on how million-plus token context window language models impact RAG, including improvements in performance, efficiency, and potential challenges.

```

## Expand Topics¶
While language models do store some Wikipedia-like knowledge in their parameters, you will get better results by incorporating relevant and recent information using a search engine.
We will start our search by generating a list of related topics, sourced from Wikipedia.
```
gen_related_topics_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
"""I'm writing a Wikipedia page for a topic mentioned below. Please identify and recommend some Wikipedia pages on closely related subjects. I'm looking for examples that provide insights into interesting aspects commonly associated with this topic, or examples that help me understand the typical content and structure included in Wikipedia pages for similar topics.

```
RelatedSubjects(topics=['million-plus token context window language models', 'RAG'])

## Generate Perspectives¶
From these related subjects, we can select representative Wikipedia editors as "subject matter experts" with distinct backgrounds and affiliations. These will help distribute the search process to encourage a more well-rounded final report.
```

## Expert Dialog¶
Now the true fun begins, each wikipedia writer is primed to role-play using the perspectives presented above. It will ask a series of questions of a second "domain expert" with access to a search engine. This generate content to generate a refined outline as well as an updated index of reference documents.
### Interview State¶
The conversation is cyclic, so we will construct it within its own graph. The State will contain messages, the reference docs, and the editor (with its own "persona") to make it easy to parallelize these conversations.
```
fromtypingimport Annotated

fromlangchain_core.messagesimport AnyMessage

    references = {}
  references.update(new_references)

#### Dialog Roles¶
The graph will have two participants: the wikipedia editor (`generate_question`), who asks questions based on its assigned role, and a domain expert (`gen_answer_chain), who uses a search engine to answer the questions as accurately as possible.

'Studying the impact of million-plus token context window language models on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework involves analyzing how these large language models affect information retrieval and generation tasks within the RAG framework. The introduction of large language models with extensive context windows, such as Google Gemini 1.5 Pro with a record 1 million token context window, has sparked discussions in the AI community about the potential implications for RAG. While there are concerns about the negative impact of supermassive context windows on RAG, there is also a recognition of the benefits they bring, enabling more use cases and enhancing performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the generative capabilities of transformer architectures with dynamic information retrieval, allowing large language models to access and integrate relevant external knowledge during text generation, leading to more accurate and credible outputs. RAG has been identified as a valuable solution to address challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination, outdated knowledge, lack of transparency, and untraceable reasoning processes. By incorporating external databases, RAG improves the consistency and coherence of generated content, especially in conversational question answering tasks. RAG has also been recognized as a powerful tool for large language models to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts, with recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 showcasing exceptional capabilities in understanding long contexts directly. There is ongoing research and benchmarking to compare the strengths of RAG and long-context LLMs, aiming to leverage the advantages of both approaches for enhanced performance in information retrieval and generation tasks within the RAG framework.\n\nCitations:\n\n[1]: https://thenewstack.io/do-enormous-llm-context-windows-spell-the-end-of-rag/\n[2]: https://medium.com/enterprise-rag/why-gemini-1-5-and-other-large-context-models-are-bullish-for-rag-ce3218930bb4\n[3]: https://medium.com/@amanatulla1606/rag-is-here-to-stay-four-reasons-why-large-context-windows-cant-replace-it-ad112013de25\n[4]: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-handbook/\n[5]: https://www.deepset.ai/blog/long-context-llms-rag\n[6]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997\n[7]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13385\n[8]: https://irisagent.com/blog/enhancing-large-language-models-a-deep-dive-into-rag-llm-technology/\n[9]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16833'

## Generate Article¶
Now it's time to generate the full article. We will first divide-and-conquer, so that each section can be tackled by an individual llm. Then we will prompt the long-form LLM to refine the finished article (since each section may use an inconsistent voice).
#### Create Retriever¶
The research process uncovers a large number of reference documents that we may want to query during the final article-writing process.
First, create the retriever:
```
fromlangchain_community.vectorstoresimport InMemoryVectorStore
fromlangchain_core.documentsimport Document
fromlangchain_openaiimport OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
reference_docs = [
  Document(page_content=v, metadata={"source": k})
  for k, v in final_state["references"].items()
]
# This really doesn't need to be a vectorstore for this size of data.
# It could just be a numpy matrix. Or you could store documents
# across requests if you want.
vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(
  reference_docs,
  embedding=embeddings,
)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(k=3)

```

API Reference: InMemoryVectorStore | Document | OpenAIEmbeddings
```
retriever.invoke("What's a long context LLM anyway?")

```

```
[Document(page_content='In Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a longer context augments our model with more information.

## Background

To fully appreciate the impact of million-plus token context window language models on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, it's essential to first understand the foundational concepts that underpin these technologies. This background section provides a comprehensive overview of both million-plus token context window language models and RAG, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of their integration and subsequent impacts on artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

### Million-Plus Token Context Window Language Models

Million-plus token context window language models, such as Gemini 1.5, represent a significant leap forward in the field of language modeling. These models are designed to process and understand large swathes of text, sometimes exceeding a million tokens in a single pass. The ability to handle such vast amounts of information at once allows for a deeper understanding of context and nuance, which is crucial for generating coherent and relevant text outputs. The development of these models involves sophisticated architecture and extensive training data, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in natural language processing. Over time, the applications of these models have evolved, extending their utility beyond mere text generation to complex tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework represents a novel approach in the realm of artificial intelligence, blending the strengths of both retrieval and generation models to enhance natural language processing capabilities. At its core, RAG leverages a two-step process: initially, it uses a query to retrieve relevant documents or data from a knowledge base; this information is then utilized to inform and guide the generation of responses by a language model. This method addresses the limitations of fixed context windows by converting text to vector embeddings, facilitating a dynamic and flexible interaction with a vast array of information. RAG's unique approach has cemented its significance in the AI landscape, offering a pathway to more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant text generation.
