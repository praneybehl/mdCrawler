**Start with Claude Code for a professional vibe coding experience.** It combines the speed of outcome-focused development with safety features that help you build real applications that work reliably.
### Quick Start (Complete Beginners)​
**5-Minute Test** - Install Claude Code, launch it, and ask it to create a simple "hello.txt" file. If that works, you're ready for the full workflow.
**Learn Plan Mode** - Practice using `Shift+Tab` twice to see what Claude will do before it does it. This safety feature prevents unwanted changes while you learn.
**Build Something Tiny** - Ask Claude to help create a simple webpage that says "Hello World" to validate your setup works correctly.
### Essential Setup Process​
**Phase 1: Foundation (Critical for Success)**
  * **Install Prerequisites** : Node.js from nodejs.org and basic terminal familiarity
  * **Install Claude Code** : Run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` then verify with `claude --version` (see Installation Guide for detailed steps)
  * **Launch Interactive Session** : Run `claude` to open the chat interface
  * **Learn Safety First** : Ask Claude to explain Plan Mode and practice activating it with `Shift+Tab` twice


**Phase 2: Project Setup**
  * **Create`CLAUDE.md`** : Ask Claude to create a project instructions file that remembers your preferences
  * **Initialize Git Repository** : Set up version control for safe experimentation and rollbacks
  * **Choose Starting Approach** : Decide between building from scratch (more learning) or using proven GitHub templates (faster results)


### Professional Vibe Coding Workflow​
**Structured Planning Approach:**
  * **Define Requirements** : Create a clear product requirements document with objectives and constraints
  * **Set Up Context Management** : Use `CLAUDE.md` to maintain persistent project knowledge across sessions
  * **Establish Safety Protocols** : Use Plan Mode for all significant changes and frequent git commits


**Implementation Strategy:**
  * **Start Simple** : Build core functionality first, focusing on one feature at a time
  * **Test with Real Data** : Use your actual information instead of "test test test" everywhere
  * **Stay Safe** : If something doesn't work after a few tries, start fresh rather than getting stuck in debug loops


### Avoiding Common Problems​
**Test Everything Thoroughly** - Don't assume things work just because they look good. Click every button, fill out every form, and try to break things on purpose.
**Save Your Work Often** - When something works, ask Claude Code to commit it to git immediately. Also ask Claude to document how the feature works in your `CLAUDE.md` file.
**Question Perfect Results** - If something works perfectly on the first try, test it harder. Real systems have rough edges.
Build Your Experience
Start with simple utilities like a password generator, weather checker, or basic calculator before attempting complex applications. Building small tools first helps you learn Claude Code's patterns and develop confidence before tackling larger projects.
##### Structured Beginning
Getting started with vibe coding requires calm, structured progression from basic setup to professional workflows. Building foundational skills through simple projects creates confidence for tackling more complex development challenges.
