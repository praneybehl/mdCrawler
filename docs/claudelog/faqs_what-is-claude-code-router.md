Claude Code Router is a proxy tool that lets you use Claude Code without an Anthropic account by routing requests to alternative AI providers. I use it to access Claude Code's interface while connecting to providers like OpenRouter, DeepSeek, and Ollama for different types of development tasks.
**Official Repository** : https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router
### How I Use It​
**Installation** - I install it globally alongside Claude Code:
```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-codenpm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

**Usage** - Instead of running regular Claude Code, I use:
```
ccr code # Starts Claude Code through the router
```

**Configuration** - I create `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` to set up my preferred AI providers and routing rules for different task types.
I use Claude Code Router primarily to access Claude Code functionality without needing an Anthropic account, while also optimizing costs by routing different tasks to appropriate models.
### Why I Use Claude Code Router​
**No Anthropic Account Required** - The primary value is accessing Claude Code without needing an Anthropic subscription. I can use the familiar Claude Code interface with any supported AI provider.
**Multi-Provider Access** - I can leverage 8+ different AI providers (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, VolcEngine, SiliconFlow, etc.) through the same interface.
**Dynamic Model Switching** - During sessions, I can switch models using `/model provider,model_name` commands for different types of tasks.
**Benefits:**
  * **No Subscription Required** : Use Claude Code interface without Anthropic account
  * **8+ Supported Providers** : OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, VolcEngine, SiliconFlow, ModelScope, DashScope
  * **Live Model Switching** : Change providers mid-session with `/model` commands
  * **Context-Based Routing** : Automatic model selection for default, background, reasoning, and long-context tasks
  * **Custom Transformers** : Provider-specific request/response handling for compatibility
  * **Cost Optimization** : Route expensive tasks to appropriate models while using cheaper ones for simple operations
  * **GitHub Actions Support** : CI/CD integration with automated model routing
  * **Flexible Configuration** : JSON-based setup with detailed routing rules


I use Claude Code Router primarily to access Claude Code without an Anthropic subscription, while also optimizing costs by routing different tasks to appropriate models. My secondary use case is as a backup solution when Claude servers experience downtime.
Cost Management
Claude Code Router enables strategic model selection based on task complexity and cost requirements, helping optimize AI usage expenses while maintaining development productivity.
