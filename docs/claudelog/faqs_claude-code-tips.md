Essential tips and shortcuts for getting the most out of Claude Code. These are practical techniques I use daily to improve development workflow and efficiency.
### Mode Management​
**Press`Shift+Tab` twice for Plan Mode** - Activate safe research mode where Claude analyzes without making changes until you approve the plan. Perfect for exploring complex problems without unwanted edits. **Read more** : Plan Mode
**Cycle`Shift+Tab` for auto-accept mode** - Toggle through `normal mode`, `auto-accept edit on`, and `plan mode`. Auto-accept eliminates permission prompts for uninterrupted coding sessions. **Read more** : Auto-Accept Permissions
### Context Window Optimization​
**Avoid the last fifth for complex tasks** - Performance degrades significantly during context window depletion. For large refactors or multi-file changes, chunk work to stay within optimal memory constraints. **Read more** : Context Window Depletion
**Use`/clear` at logical points** - Start fresh conversations at strategic breakpoints within your task flow. Clear after completing research phases, finishing components, or when shifting between different types of work to maintain optimal performance.
**Update`CLAUDE.md` at checkpoints** - Document system quirks, gotchas, and key insights in your `CLAUDE.md` as you discover them. Record architectural decisions, edge cases, and workflow patterns to create reference points for future development sessions.
### Performance Enhancement​
**Use`ultrathink` for complex analysis** - This magic word triggers maximum thinking budget (31,999 tokens) for deep problem-solving and complex reasoning tasks. **Read more** : What is UltraThink
**Use multiple rounds of plan mode** - For complex projects, refine the plan before execution. Let Claude create a plan, review it, then stay in plan mode to improve and perfect the approach until you have an optimal strategy.
**Chunk memory-intensive tasks** - Break large refactors, feature implementations, and architectural changes into smaller pieces. Complete individual components before moving to integration.
### Configuration Setup​
**Create`CLAUDE.md` for project context** - Set up project-specific configuration and coding patterns. Claude uses this to understand your codebase and maintain consistency. **Read more** : CLAUDE.md Supremacy
**Add MCP servers for enhanced capabilities** - Integrate web search, documentation access, and specialized tools through Model Context Protocol servers. **Read more** : How to Add MCP
**Configure allowed tools** - Customize which operations auto-accept mode permits through `allowedTools` in `~/.claude.json` for granular permission control. **Read more** : Configuration Guide
##### Workflow Optimization Mastery
Shift+Tab twice activates Plan Mode for safe analysis before execution. Avoid last fifth of context window for memory-intensive tasks and chunk complex operations.

Daily Workflow Pattern
Start sessions in `plan mode` to understand what needs to be done, approve the approach, then switch to `auto-accept mode` for execution. Use `/clear` between major tasks to maintain optimal performance.
