Use this systematic approach to determine if Claude Code issues are widespread or isolated to your setup.
### Official Status Check​
**Primary sources for real-time status:**
  * **Official status page** : https://status.anthropic.com/ - Anthropic's real-time service status
  * **Community reports** : r/ClaudeAI subreddit - Live user reports and discussions


### Is It Just You?​
**Quick diagnostic steps:**
  * **Test other websites** : Verify your internet connection works
  * **Try different device** : Same network, different computer or phone
  * **Check with team members** : Ask colleagues if they're experiencing issues
  * **Test different networks** : Try mobile hotspot vs home WiFi


### Typical Patterns​
Common scenarios include:
  * **Widespread outage** : Multiple users report on Reddit within minutes
  * **Just you** : Status page shows "operational" but you still have issues
  * **Regional issues** : Some geographic areas affected, others working fine


### Quick Diagnosis Timeline​
  * **0-2 minutes** : Check status page and Reddit for immediate reports
  * **2-5 minutes** : Test basic connectivity and try different device
  * **5+ minutes** : If still having issues and no widespread reports, likely individual problem


### Most Likely Scenario​
**Usually just a brief hiccup** - If status.anthropic.com shows "operational," it's probably a brief connectivity issue that will resolve in 1-2 minutes. True widespread outages affecting all Claude Code users are rare and quickly acknowledged by Anthropic.
### When It's Widespread​
**Signs of actual service outages:**
  * **Status page** : Shows incidents or degraded performance
  * **Multiple Reddit posts** : Within 5-10 minutes reporting same issue
  * **Anthropic acknowledgment** : On social media or status updates
  * **Different error types** : Across multiple users


### When It's Individual​
**Signs it's likely your setup:**
  * **Status page** : Shows all systems operational
  * **No community reports** : Of similar issues
  * **Works on different device** : Or network
  * **Specific to your configuration** : Or recent changes


Recommended Approach
Check the status page first, then Reddit. If both show no issues but you're still having problems, focus on your local network and configuration rather than waiting for a service fix.
##### Global Outage Detection
Status pages and Reddit tell the truth about widespread issues within minutes. If it's just you, stop waiting for Anthropic to fix your local network problems.
