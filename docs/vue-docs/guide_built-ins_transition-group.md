# TransitionGroup ​
`<TransitionGroup>` is a built-in component designed for animating the insertion, removal, and order change of elements or components that are rendered in a list.
## Differences from `<Transition>` ​
`<TransitionGroup>` supports the same props, CSS transition classes, and JavaScript hook listeners as `<Transition>`, with the following differences:
  * By default, it doesn't render a wrapper element. But you can specify an element to be rendered with the `tag` prop.
  * Transition modes are not available, because we are no longer alternating between mutually exclusive elements.
  * Elements inside are **always required** to have a unique `key` attribute.
  * CSS transition classes will be applied to individual elements in the list, **not** to the group / container itself.


TIP
When used in in-DOM templates, it should be referenced as `<transition-group>`.
## Enter / Leave Transitions ​
Here is an example of applying enter / leave transitions to a `v-for` list using `<TransitionGroup>`:
template```
<TransitionGroup name="list" tag="ul">
 <li v-for="item in items" :key="item">
  {{ item }}
 </li>
</TransitionGroup>
```

css```
.list-enter-active,
.list-leave-active {
 transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
.list-enter-from,
.list-leave-to {
 opacity: 0;
 transform: translateX(30px);
}
```

  * 2
  * 3

## Move Transitions ​
The above demo has some obvious flaws: when an item is inserted or removed, its surrounding items instantly "jump" into place instead of moving smoothly. We can fix this by adding a few additional CSS rules:
css```
.list-move, /* apply transition to moving elements */
.list-enter-active,
.list-leave-active {
 transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
.list-enter-from,
.list-leave-to {
 opacity: 0;
 transform: translateX(30px);
}
/* ensure leaving items are taken out of layout flow so that moving
  animations can be calculated correctly. */
.list-leave-active {
 position: absolute;
}
```

Now it looks much better - even animating smoothly when the whole list is shuffled:

  * 2
  * 3
  * 4
  * 5

### Custom TransitionGroup classes ​
You can also specify custom transition classes for the moving element by passing the `moveClass` prop to `<TransitionGroup>`, just like custom transition classes on `<Transition>`.
## Staggering List Transitions ​
By communicating with JavaScript transitions through data attributes, it's also possible to stagger transitions in a list. First, we render the index of an item as a data attribute on the DOM element:
template```
<TransitionGroup
 tag="ul"
 :css="false"
 @before-enter="onBeforeEnter"
 @enter="onEnter"
 @leave="onLeave"
>
 <li
  v-for="(item, index) in computedList"
  :key="item.msg"
  :data-index="index"
 >
  {{ item.msg }}
 </li>
</TransitionGroup>
```

Then, in JavaScript hooks, we animate the element with a delay based on the data attribute. This example is using the GSAP library to perform the animation:
js```
function onEnter(el, done) {
 gsap.to(el, {
  opacity: 1,
  height: '1.6em',
  delay: el.dataset.index * 0.15,
  onComplete: done
 })
}
```
