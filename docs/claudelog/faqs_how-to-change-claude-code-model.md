I switch between Claude models based on task complexity and token efficiency. Sonnet 4 for daily development work, Opus 4 when I need deep reasoning for architectural decisions.
### How to Use It​
**Environment Variable** - Set the default model in your shell configuration:
```
# Set default model (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`)export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"# Alternative modelexport ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-opus-4-20250514"
```

**Command Line Flag** - Specify model when starting Claude Code:
```
# Start with Sonnet 4claude --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514# Start with Opus 4claude --model claude-opus-4-20250514
```

**Mid-Session Switching** - Change models during active sessions:
```
# Full model names/model claude-opus-4-20250514/model claude-sonnet-4-20250514# Shorthand commands (easier to type)/model opus/model sonnet# Alternative shorthand/mode opus/mode sonnet
```

### Why Use Different Models​
Each Claude model excels in different scenarios, and switching between them optimizes both performance and cost efficiency based on task requirements.
**Benefits:**
  * **Task Optimization** - Match model capabilities to specific development needs and complexity levels
  * **Cost Management** - Use less expensive models for simpler tasks while reserving premium models for complex work
  * **Performance Balance** - Optimize response speed and quality based on urgency and complexity requirements
  * **Token Efficiency** - Manage usage limits by selecting appropriate models for different types of work
  * **Workflow Flexibility** - Adapt model selection to changing requirements within the same development session


### Model Selection Strategy​
**Claude 4 Sonnet** - Default choice for balanced performance:
  * Daily coding tasks and bug fixes
  * Code reviews and documentation
  * Most refactoring and testing work
  * General development activities


**Claude 4 Opus** - Complex reasoning and analysis:
  * Architectural decisions and design patterns
  * Large-scale refactoring across multiple files
  * Performance optimization analysis
  * Complex debugging and problem-solving


Session Management
Switching models mid-session increases token consumption because the new model must process the entire conversation history. Consider starting fresh sessions when changing models for long conversations.
Strategic Selection
Start with `claude --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for most work. Switch to Opus 4 with `/model opus` only when encountering problems requiring deeper reasoning.
##### Dynamic Model Selection
Switch between models using environment variables, command flags, or mid-session commands. Opus for complex reasoning and architectural decisions, Sonnet for daily development efficiency.
