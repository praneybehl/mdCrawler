Role Sub-Agents analyze tasks from multiple perspectives simultaneously. Ask Claude to `Create sub-agents and analyze this from multiple perspectives: security, senior engineer, factual reviewer` then request `consolidate the findings from all sub-agents and provide unified recommendations.`
### Why Use Role Sub-Agentsâ€‹
Multiple roles analyze problems in parallel, creating insights difficult through single-role analysis while maximizing Sonnet's capabilities.
**Benefits:**
  * **Diverse Perspectives** - Security, engineering, UX, creative roles provide comprehensive coverage
  * **Cost Optimization** - Often outperforms expensive Opus model
  * **Specialized Tools** - Each role uses tools suited to their expertise
  * **Less Blind Spots** - Multiple perspectives reviewing the same task


I use role sub-agents for thorough validation of complex features, then ask Claude to consolidate all perspectives into actionable recommendations. I normally action this process in Plan Mode.
Role Examples
Try `security, senior engineer, factual reviewer` for code analysis or `creative, nooby user, designer, marketing, seo perspective` for UX evaluation.
##### Multi-Role Analysis
Role Sub-Agents enable parallel analysis from multiple perspectives simultaneously, creating comprehensive insights difficult with single-perspective analysis.
