# Plugins ​
## Introduction ​
Plugins are self-contained code that usually add app-level functionality to Vue. This is how we install a plugin:
js```
import { createApp } from 'vue'
const app = createApp({})
app.use(myPlugin, {
 /* optional options */
})
```

A plugin is defined as either an object that exposes an `install()` method, or simply a function that acts as the install function itself. The install function receives the app instance along with additional options passed to `app.use()`, if any:
js```
const myPlugin = {
 install(app, options) {
  // configure the app
 }
}
```

There is no strictly defined scope for a plugin, but common scenarios where plugins are useful include:
  1. Register one or more global components or custom directives with `app.component()` and `app.directive()`.
  2. Make a resource injectable throughout the app by calling `app.provide()`.
  3. Add some global instance properties or methods by attaching them to `app.config.globalProperties`.
  4. A library that needs to perform some combination of the above (e.g. vue-router).


## Writing a Plugin ​
In order to better understand how to create your own Vue.js plugins, we will create a very simplified version of a plugin that displays `i18n` (short for Internationalization) strings.
Let's begin by setting up the plugin object. It is recommended to create it in a separate file and export it, as shown below to keep the logic contained and separate.
js```
// plugins/i18n.js
export default {
 install: (app, options) => {
  // Plugin code goes here
 }
}
```

We want to create a translation function. This function will receive a dot-delimited `key` string, which we will use to look up the translated string in the user-provided options. This is the intended usage in templates:
template```
<h1>{{ $translate('greetings.hello') }}</h1>
```

Since this function should be globally available in all templates, we will make it so by attaching it to `app.config.globalProperties` in our plugin:
js```
// plugins/i18n.js
export default {
 install: (app, options) => {
  // inject a globally available $translate() method
  app.config.globalProperties.$translate = (key) => {
   // retrieve a nested property in `options`
   // using `key` as the path
   return key.split('.').reduce((o, i) => {
    if (o) return o[i]
   }, options)
  }
 }
}
```

Our `$translate` function will take a string such as `greetings.hello`, look inside the user provided configuration and return the translated value.
The object containing the translated keys should be passed to the plugin during installation via additional parameters to `app.use()`:
js```
import i18nPlugin from './plugins/i18n'
app.use(i18nPlugin, {
 greetings: {
  hello: 'Bonjour!'
 }
})
```

Now, our initial expression `$translate('greetings.hello')` will be replaced by `Bonjour!` at runtime.

TIP
Use global properties scarcely, since it can quickly become confusing if too many global properties injected by different plugins are used throughout an app.
### Provide / Inject with Plugins ​
Plugins also allow us to use `inject` to provide a function or attribute to the plugin's users. For example, we can allow the application to have access to the `options` parameter to be able to use the translations object.
js```
// plugins/i18n.js
export default {
 install: (app, options) => {
  app.provide('i18n', options)
 }
}
```

Plugin users will now be able to inject the plugin options into their components using the `i18n` key:
vue```
<script setup>
import { inject } from 'vue'
const i18n = inject('i18n')
console.log(i18n.greetings.hello)
</script>
```

js```
export default {
 inject: ['i18n'],
 created() {
  console.log(this.i18n.greetings.hello)
 }
}
```

### Bundle for NPM ​
If you further want to build and publish your plugin for others to use, see Vite's section on Library Mode.
