# Describing the UI
React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable _components._ From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, you’ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components.

## Your first component 
React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called _components_. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. Here is a `Gallery` component rendering three `Profile` components:

## Importing and exporting components 
You can declare many components in one file, but large files can get difficult to navigate. To solve this, you can _export_ a component into its own file, and then _import_ that component from another file:
Gallery.jsProfile.js
Gallery.js
ResetFork
```
import Profile from './Profile.js';
export default function Gallery() {
 return (
  <section>
   <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
   <Profile />
   <Profile />
   <Profile />
  </section>
 );
}

```

## Writing markup with JSX 
Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information.
If we paste existing HTML markup into a React component, it won’t always work:
App.js
App.js

```
export default function TodoList() {
 return (
  // This doesn't quite work!
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img
   src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
   alt="Hedy Lamarr"
   class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
   <li>Invent new traffic lights
   <li>Rehearse a movie scene
   <li>Improve spectrum technology
  </ul>

```

If you have existing HTML like this, you can fix it using a converter:

    alt="Hedy Lamarr"
    className="photo"
   />
   <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve spectrum technology</li>
   </ul>
  </>
 );
}

## JavaScript in JSX with curly braces 
JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to “open a window” to JavaScript:
App.js
App.js
Download ResetFork
```
const person = {
 name: 'Gregorio Y. Zara',
 theme: {
  backgroundColor: 'black',
  color: 'pink'
 }
};
export default function TodoList() {
 return (
  <div style={person.theme}>
   <h1>{person.name}'s Todos</h1>
   <img
    className="avatar"
    src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
    alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
   />
   <ul>
    <li>Improve the videophone</li>
    <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
    <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
 );
}

## Passing props to a component 
React components use _props_ to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, functions, and even JSX!

import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js'
export default function Profile() {

  <Card>
   <Avatar
    size={100}
    person={{
     name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
     imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
    }}
   />
  </Card>
 );
}
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
 return (
  <img
   className="avatar"
   src={getImageUrl(person)}
   alt={person.name}
   width={size}
   height={size}
  />
 );

function Card({ children }) {
 return (
  <div className="card">
   {children}
  </div>
 );
}

```

## Conditional rendering 
Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like `if` statements, `&&`, and `? :` operators.
In this example, the JavaScript `&&` operator is used to conditionally render a checkmark:
App.js
App.js

```
function Item({ name, isPacked }) {
 return (
  <li className="item">
   {name} {isPacked && '✅'}
  </li>
 );
}
export default function PackingList() {
 return (
  <section>
   <h1>Sally Ride's Packing List</h1>
   <ul>
    <Item
     isPacked={true}
     name="Space suit"
    />
    <Item
     isPacked={true}
     name="Helmet with a golden leaf"
    />
    <Item
     isPacked={false}
     name="Photo of Tam"
    />
   </ul>
  </section>
 );
}

```

## Rendering lists 
You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use JavaScript’s `filter()` and `map()` with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.
For each array item, you will need to specify a `key`. Usually, you will want to use an ID from the database as a `key`. Keys let React keep track of each item’s place in the list even if the list changes.

import { people } from './data.js';

  <li key={person.id}>
   <img
    src={getImageUrl(person)}
    alt={person.name}
   />
   <p>
    <b>{person.name}:</b>
    {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
    known for {person.accomplishment}
   </p>
  </li>
 );
 return (

   <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  </article>
 );

## Keeping components pure 
Some JavaScript functions are _pure._ A pure function:
  * **Minds its own business.** It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
  * **Same inputs, same output.** Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.


By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. Here is an example of an impure component:
App.js
App.js
Download ResetFork
```
let guest = 0;
function Cup() {
 // Bad: changing a preexisting variable!
 guest = guest + 1;
 return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}
export default function TeaSet() {
 return (
  <>
   <Cup />
   <Cup />
   <Cup />
  </>
 );
}

```

You can make this component pure by passing a prop instead of modifying a preexisting variable:
App.js
App.js
Download ResetFork
```
function Cup({ guest }) {
 return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>;
}
export default function TeaSet() {
 return (
  <>
   <Cup guest={1} />
   <Cup guest={2} />
   <Cup guest={3} />
  </>
 );
}

```

## Your UI as a tree 
React uses trees to model the relationships between components and modules.
A React render tree is a representation of the parent and child relationship between components.
![A tree graph with five nodes, with each node representing a component. The root node is located at the top the tree graph and is labelled 'Root Component'. It has two arrows extending down to two nodes labelled 'Component A' and 'Component C'. Each of the arrows is labelled with 'renders'. 'Component A' has a single 'renders' arrow to a node labelled 'Component B'. 'Component C' has a single 'renders' arrow to a node labelled 'Component D'.](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fgeneric_render_tree.dark.png&w=1080&q=75)

An example React render tree.
Components near the top of the tree, near the root component, are considered top-level components. Components with no child components are leaf components. This categorization of components is useful for understanding data flow and rendering performance.
Modelling the relationship between JavaScript modules is another useful way to understand your app. We refer to it as a module dependency tree.
![A tree graph with five nodes. Each node represents a JavaScript module. The top-most node is labelled 'RootModule.js'. It has three arrows extending to the nodes: 'ModuleA.js', 'ModuleB.js', and 'ModuleC.js'. Each arrow is labelled as 'imports'. 'ModuleC.js' node has a single 'imports' arrow that points to a node labelled 'ModuleD.js'.](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fgeneric_dependency_tree.dark.png&w=1080&q=75)

An example module dependency tree.
A dependency tree is often used by build tools to bundle all the relevant JavaScript code for the client to download and render. A large bundle size regresses user experience for React apps. Understanding the module dependency tree is helpful to debug such issues.
