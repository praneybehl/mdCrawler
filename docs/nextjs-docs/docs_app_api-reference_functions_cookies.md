# cookies
`cookies` is an **async** function that allows you to read the HTTP incoming request cookies in Server Component, and read/write outgoing request cookies in Server Actions or Route Handlers.
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
constcookieStore=awaitcookies()
consttheme=cookieStore.get('theme')
return'...'
}
```

## Reference
### Methods
The following methods are available:
Method| Return Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`get('name')`| Object| Accepts a cookie name and returns an object with the name and value.  
`getAll()`| Array of objects| Returns a list of all the cookies with a matching name.  
`has('name')`| Boolean| Accepts a cookie name and returns a boolean based on if the cookie exists.  
`set(name, value, options)`| -| Accepts a cookie name, value, and options and sets the outgoing request cookie.  
`delete(name)`| -| Accepts a cookie name and deletes the cookie.  
`clear()`| -| Deletes all cookies.  
`toString()`| String| Returns a string representation of the cookies.  
### Options
When setting a cookie, the following properties from the `options` object are supported:
Option| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
`name`| String| Specifies the name of the cookie.  
`value`| String| Specifies the value to be stored in the cookie.  
`expires`| Date| Defines the exact date when the cookie will expire.  
`maxAge`| Number| Sets the cookie’s lifespan in seconds.  
`domain`| String| Specifies the domain where the cookie is available.  
`path`| String, default: `'/'`| Limits the cookie's scope to a specific path within the domain.  
`secure`| Boolean| Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS connections for added security.  
`httpOnly`| Boolean| Restricts the cookie to HTTP requests, preventing client-side access.  
`sameSite`| Boolean, `'lax'`, `'strict'`, `'none'`| Controls the cookie's cross-site request behavior.  
`priority`| String (`"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`)| Specifies the cookie's priority  
`encode('value')`| Function| Specifies a function that will be used to encode a cookie's value.  
`partitioned`| Boolean| Indicates whether the cookie is partitioned.  
The only option with a default value is `path`.
To learn more about these options, see the MDN docs.
## Good to know
  * `cookies` is an **asynchronous** function that returns a promise. You must use `async/await` or React's `use` function to access cookies. 
    * In version 14 and earlier, `cookies` was a synchronous function. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.
  * `cookies` is a Dynamic API whose returned values cannot be known ahead of time. Using it in a layout or page will opt a route into dynamic rendering.
  * The `.delete` method can only be called: 
    * In a Server Action or Route Handler.
    * If it belongs to the same domain from which `.set` is called. Additionally, the code must be executed on the same protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) as the cookie you want to delete.
  * HTTP does not allow setting cookies after streaming starts, so you must use `.set` in a Server Action or Route Handler.


## Understanding Cookie Behavior in Server Components
When working with cookies in Server Components, it's important to understand that cookies are fundamentally a client-side storage mechanism:
  * **Reading cookies** works in Server Components because you're accessing the cookie data that the client's browser sends to the server in the HTTP request headers.
  * **Setting cookies** cannot be done directly in a Server Component, even when using a Route Handler or Server Action. This is because cookies are actually stored by the browser, not the server.


The server can only send instructions (via `Set-Cookie` headers) to tell the browser to store cookies - the actual storage happens on the client side. This is why cookie operations that modify state (`.set`, `.delete`, `.clear`) must be performed in a Route Handler or Server Action where the response headers can be properly set.
## Examples
### Getting a cookie
You can use the `(await cookies()).get('name')` method to get a single cookie:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
constcookieStore=awaitcookies()
consttheme=cookieStore.get('theme')
return'...'
}
```

### Getting all cookies
You can use the `(await cookies()).getAll()` method to get all cookies with a matching name. If `name` is unspecified, it returns all the available cookies.
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
constcookieStore=awaitcookies()
returncookieStore.getAll().map((cookie) => (
  <divkey={cookie.name}>
   <p>Name: {cookie.name}</p>
   <p>Value: {cookie.value}</p>
  </div>
 ))
}
```

### Setting a cookie
You can use the `(await cookies()).set(name, value, options)` method in a Server Action or Route Handler to set a cookie. The `options` object is optional.
app/actions.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
'use server'
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportasyncfunctioncreate(data) {
constcookieStore=awaitcookies()
cookieStore.set('name','lee')
// or
cookieStore.set('name','lee', { secure:true })
// or
cookieStore.set({
  name:'name',
  value:'lee',
  httpOnly:true,
  path:'/',
 })
}
```

### Checking if a cookie exists
You can use the `(await cookies()).has(name)` method to check if a cookie exists:
app/page.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
constcookieStore=awaitcookies()
consthasCookie=cookieStore.has('theme')
return'...'
}
```

### Deleting cookies
There are three ways you can delete a cookie.
Using the `delete()` method:
app/actions.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
'use server'
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportasyncfunctiondelete(data) {
 (awaitcookies()).delete('name')
}
```

Setting a new cookie with the same name and an empty value:
app/actions.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
'use server'
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportasyncfunctiondelete(data) {
 (awaitcookies()).set('name','')
}
```

Setting the `maxAge` to 0 will immediately expire a cookie. `maxAge` accepts a value in seconds.
app/actions.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
'use server'
import { cookies } from'next/headers'
exportasyncfunctiondelete(data) {
 (awaitcookies()).set('name','value', { maxAge:0 })
}
```
