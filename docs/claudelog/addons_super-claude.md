**Configuration framework with specialized commands and cognitive personas for optimized Claude Code workflows**
**Author** : NomenAK | GitHub Repo | Stats unavailable
### Overview​
SuperClaude is a configuration framework that enhances Claude Code through specialized commands, cognitive personas, and development methodologies. It provides structured guidance for development workflows using a modular configuration system.
### Features​
  * **19 Specialized Commands** - Complete development lifecycle coverage across four categories: 
    * **Development** (/build, /code, /debug) - Implementation and construction
    * **Analysis** (/analyze, /optimize, /refactor, /review, /audit) - Code improvement
    * **Operations** (/deploy, /test, /monitor, /backup, /scale, /migrate) - System management
    * **Design** (/design, /plan, /document, /workflow, /research) - Planning and documentation
  * **9 Cognitive Personas** - Domain expertise specialists: architect, frontend, backend, security, analyzer, qa, performance, refactorer, mentor
  * **MCP Integration** - Works with Context7, Sequential, Magic, and Puppeteer tools
  * **Token Efficiency** - Compression options and optimized workflows
  * **Modular Configuration** - Flexible system with @include references and flag inheritance
  * **Evidence-Based Development** - Structured approach to development practices


### Installation​
**Prerequisites**
  * Claude Code installed and configured
  * Git for repository cloning
  * Linux, macOS, or Windows WSL environment


**Setup SuperClaude**
```
# Clone the repositorygit clone https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude.gitcd SuperClaude# Basic installation (installs to ~/.claude/ by default)./install.sh# Advanced installation options./install.sh --dir /custom/path  # Custom installation directory./install.sh --update       # Update existing installation./install.sh --dry-run --verbose # Preview installation changes
```

**Installation Notes**
  * **Zero Dependencies** - No additional packages required beyond Claude Code
  * **Default Location** - Configuration files installed to `~/.claude/` directory
  * **Configuration Overwrite** - Installation will overwrite existing CLAUDE.md files


### Usage​
**Development Workflow Commands**
```
# Architecture and design phase/design --api --ddd --architect# Implementation with testing/build --feature --tdd --backend# Quality assurance/test --coverage --e2e --qa# Security review/audit --security --performance# Deployment planning/deploy --env staging --plan --ops
```

**Persona Flag Examples**
```
# Use any persona as a universal flag/analyze --frontend   # Frontend specialist analysis/optimize --performance # Performance-focused optimization/review --security   # Security-focused code review/refactor --architect  # Architectural refactoring approach
```

**How It Works**
  1. **Command Selection** - Choose from 19 specialized commands for different development phases
  2. **Persona Application** - Apply cognitive personas as universal command flags
  3. **Configuration Loading** - Modular system with @include references for flexible setup
  4. **Enhanced Context** - Claude Code receives structured, domain-specific guidance
  5. **Optimized Output** - Consistent, high-quality responses tailored to development context
