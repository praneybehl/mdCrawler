Plan Mode is Claude Code's safety feature that lets Claude research and analyze without making any changes until you approve the plan. When activated, Claude can read files but cannot edit, create, or execute anything.
### How to Use It​
Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through modes until you reach Plan Mode. Claude researches safely, presents a plan, then press `Shift+Tab` to cycle back to normal mode for execution.
### Why Use Plan Mode​
Plan Mode provides safety for sensitive projects, structured planning for complex tasks, and efficient token usage with expensive models like Opus. You control when changes actually happen instead of guessing whether Claude will edit files.
**Benefits:**
  * **Safety** - No unwanted file edits or command execution
  * **Structured Planning** - Consistent, formatted responses from Claude
  * **Token Efficiency** - Quick analysis without expensive execution
  * **Control** - You approve before any changes happen


I use Plan Mode when I want Claude to think through complex problems before touching any code.
Model Optimization
Plan Mode excels with Claude 4 Opus for cost-effective intelligence, and with Sonnet for iterative planning rounds that enhance performance before execution.

##### Safety Through Planning
Plan Mode provides structured analysis without risking unwanted file modifications or execution. Use Shift+Tab to cycle between modes and maintain complete control over when changes occur.
