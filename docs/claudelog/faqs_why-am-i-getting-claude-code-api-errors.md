Claude Code API errors are usually temporary connectivity issues, not actual API outages. Most resolve quickly with basic troubleshooting.
### Common API Error Types​
  * **Connection timeout** : Network routing delay
  * **503 Service Unavailable** : Server temporarily overloaded
  * **Authentication failed** : Temporary API key validation issue
  * **Rate limiting** : Too many requests in short timeframe


### Quick Diagnosis Steps​
  * **Check official status** : Visit https://status.anthropic.com/ for API-specific updates
  * **Test basic connection** : Restart Claude Code or try `claude --version`
  * **Review recent changes** : New firewall rules, VPN configuration, or updated network settings
  * **Check community reports** : Visit r/ClaudeAI subreddit for similar API error reports


### API vs Service Issues​
**API outage indicators:**
  * Affects all API users
  * Announced on official status page
  * Multiple users report identical errors
  * Anthropic acknowledges the issue


**Individual issue indicators:**
  * Usually local network problems
  * Authentication or configuration errors
  * Rate limiting from heavy usage
  * Firewall or VPN blocking requests


### Authentication Problems​
Common authentication issues include:
  * **Expired API keys** : Check your Anthropic Console
  * **Invalid subscription** : Verify your plan is active
  * **Regional restrictions** : Some areas have limited access
  * **Network blocking** : Corporate firewalls often block AI APIs


### Rate Limiting Issues​
**Signs you're hitting rate limits:**
  * Errors after heavy usage periods
  * Works fine, then suddenly stops
  * Error messages mentioning quotas or limits


**Solutions:**
  * Wait 5-10 minutes before retrying
  * Check your usage in Anthropic Console
  * Upgrade to higher tier plan if needed


### Network Troubleshooting​
**Basic connectivity tests:**
  * Can you access other websites normally?
  * Does Claude Code work on mobile hotspot?
  * Are other team members having issues?
  * Did you recently change network settings?


### When to Escalate​
**Contact Anthropic support if:**
  * API status shows operational but errors persist
  * Multiple authentication methods fail
  * Errors occur across different networks
  * Issue persists for more than 30 minutes


Resolution Pattern
90% of API errors resolve within 5 minutes by restarting Claude Code or waiting for temporary server issues to clear. Only escalate after ruling out local network and authentication problems.
##### API Connection Failure
Most API errors are networking hiccups masquerading as serious system failures. Restart Claude Code before assuming Anthropic's infrastructure is broken.
