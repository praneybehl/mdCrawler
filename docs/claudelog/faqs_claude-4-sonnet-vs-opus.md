Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 4 Opus serve different roles in Claude Code development workflows. Understanding their strengths helps you optimize both performance and costs by choosing the right model for each task type.
### How to Choose Between Them​
**Set Claude 4 Sonnet as your default** for most development work, then tactically switch to Opus for complex architectural decisions:
```
# Set Sonnet as defaultexport ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"# Switch to Opus for specific complex tasksclaude --model claude-opus-4-20250514 "Review codebase"
```

I use Opus for 90% of my development work and only switch to Sonnet for simple, routine tasks.
### Why Choose Strategically​
**Cost Optimization** - Claude 4 Opus costs approximately 5x more than Claude 4 Sonnet, making tactical selection crucial for budget management.
**Performance Balance** - Sonnet provides excellent performance for standard development tasks while Opus excels at complex reasoning and architectural decisions. Opus can be overkill for simple tasks, making responses slower than necessary.
**Workflow Efficiency** - Using the right model for each task type optimizes both speed and quality without overspending on unnecessary capability.
**Claude 4 Sonnet Best For:**
  * **Standard Development** - Feature implementation and routine coding tasks
  * **Debugging & Troubleshooting** - Most debugging scenarios and error resolution
  * **Code Generation** - Moderate complexity code creation and editing
  * **Documentation** - Writing and editing technical documentation
  * **Task Coordination** - Workflow management and sub-agent orchestration
  * **Daily Development** - 80% of typical Claude Code usage


**Claude 4 Opus Best For:**
  * **Complex Architecture** - System design requiring deep reasoning and planning
  * **Strategic Planning** - Multi-phase project planning and implementation strategies
  * **Algorithm Optimization** - Time complexity analysis and performance optimization
  * **Multi-Step Logic** - Intricate problems with complex dependencies
  * **Creative Solutions** - Novel approaches requiring nuanced understanding
  * **Code Reviews** - Architectural judgment and design pattern evaluation
  * **Complex Refactoring** - Large-scale changes across multiple interconnected systems
  * **Critical Decisions** - When maximum reasoning capability is essential


**Cost-Performance Benefits:**
  * **5x Cost Difference** - Tactical selection can reduce costs by 60-80%
  * **Quality Maintenance** - Right-sized intelligence for each task type
  * **Budget Flexibility** - Savings allow for more complex task experimentation
  * **Orchestration Opportunities** - Cost savings enable sub-agent delegation strategies


I observe that most developers default to Opus for everything, missing significant cost optimization opportunities while not necessarily improving output quality for routine tasks.
Tactical Strategy
Start with Sonnet as your default model. When you encounter complex architectural decisions or intricate reasoning challenges, explicitly switch to Opus for those specific tasks.
Cost Awareness
Since Opus costs 5x more than Sonnet, using Sonnet for routine tasks allows you to affordably use Opus when you truly need its advanced reasoning capabilities.
##### Tactical Resource Allocation
Advanced practitioners balance computational expense with task complexity, creating sustainable workflows through strategic model selection and orchestrated intelligence deployment.
