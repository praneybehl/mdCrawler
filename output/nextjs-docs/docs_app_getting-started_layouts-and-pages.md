# How to create layouts and pages
Next.js uses **file-system based routing** , meaning you can use folders and files to define routes. This page will guide you through how to create layouts and pages, and link between them.
## Creating a page
A **page** is UI that is rendered on a specific route. To create a page, add a `page` file inside the `app` directory and default export a React component. For example, to create an index page (`/`):
![page.js special file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fpage-special-file.png&w=3840&q=75)![page.js special file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fpage-special-file.png&w=3840&q=75)
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
return <h1>Hello Next.js!</h1>
}
```

## Creating a layout
A layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not rerender.
You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a `layout` file. The component should accept a `children` prop which can be a page or another layout.
For example, to create a layout that accepts your index page as child, add a `layout` file inside the `app` directory:
![layout.js special file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Flayout-special-file.png&w=3840&q=75)![layout.js special file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Flayout-special-file.png&w=3840&q=75)
app/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
exportdefaultfunctionDashboardLayout({
 children,
}: {
 children:React.ReactNode
}) {
return (
  <htmllang="en">
   <body>
    {/* Layout UI */}
    {/* Place children where you want to render a page or nested layout */}
    <main>{children}</main>
   </body>
  </html>
 )
}
```

The layout above is called a root layout because it's defined at the root of the `app` directory. The root layout is **required** and must contain `html` and `body` tags.
## Creating a nested route
A nested route is a route composed of multiple URL segments. For example, the `/blog/[slug]` route is composed of three segments:
  * `/` (Root Segment)
  * `blog` (Segment)
  * `[slug]` (Leaf Segment)


In Next.js:
  * **Folders** are used to define the route segments that map to URL segments.
  * **Files** (like `page` and `layout`) are used to create UI that is shown for a segment.


To create nested routes, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, to add a route for `/blog`, create a folder called `blog` in the `app` directory. Then, to make `/blog` publicly accessible, add a `page` file:
![File hierarchy showing blog folder and a page.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fblog-nested-route.png&w=3840&q=75)![File hierarchy showing blog folder and a page.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fblog-nested-route.png&w=3840&q=75)
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { getPosts } from'@/lib/posts'
import { Post } from'@/ui/post'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
constposts=awaitgetPosts()
return (
  <ul>
   {posts.map((post) => (
    <Postkey={post.id} post={post} />
   ))}
  </ul>
 )
}
```

You can continue nesting folders to create nested routes. For example, to create a route for a specific blog post, create a new `[slug]` folder inside `blog` and add a `page` file:
![File hierarchy showing blog folder with a nested slug folder and a page.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fblog-post-nested-route.png&w=3840&q=75)![File hierarchy showing blog folder with a nested slug folder and a page.js file](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fblog-post-nested-route.png&w=3840&q=75)
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
functiongenerateStaticParams() {}
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
return <h1>Hello, Blog Post Page!</h1>
}
```

> **Good to know** : Wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g. `[slug]`) creates a special dynamic route segment used to generate multiple pages from data. This is useful for blog posts, product pages, etc.
## Nesting layouts
By default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are also nested, which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop. You can nest layouts by adding `layout` inside specific route segments (folders).
For example, to create a layout for the `/blog` route, add a new `layout` file inside the `blog` folder.
![File hierarchy showing root layout wrapping the blog layout](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fnested-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![File hierarchy showing root layout wrapping the blog layout](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fnested-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)
app/blog/layout.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
exportdefaultfunctionBlogLayout({
 children,
}: {
 children:React.ReactNode
}) {
return <section>{children}</section>
}
```

If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (`app/layout.js`) would wrap the blog layout (`app/blog/layout.js`), which would wrap the blog (`app/blog/page.js`) and blog post page (`app/blog/[slug]/page.js`).
## Linking between pages
You can use the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes. `<Link>` is a built-in Next.js component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation.
For example, to generate a list of blog posts, import `<Link>` from `next/link` and pass a `href` prop to the component:
app/ui/post.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import Link from'next/link'
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPost({ post }) {
constposts=awaitgetPosts()
return (
  <ul>
   {posts.map((post) => (
    <likey={post.slug}>
     <Linkhref={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
    </li>
   ))}
  </ul>
 )
}
```

`<Link>` is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes in your Next.js application. However, you can also use the `useRouter` hook for more advanced navigation.
