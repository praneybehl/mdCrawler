Files upload and handling
###  Uploading files 
To upload files, you must first add a `file` field to your collection:
![File field screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/file-field.png)
Once added, you could create/update a Record and upload "documents" files by sending a `multipart/form-data` request using the _Records create/update APIs_.
Each uploaded file will be stored with the original filename (sanitized) and suffixed with a random part (usually 10 characters). For example `test_52iwbgds7l.png`.
The max allowed size of a single file currently is limited to ~8GB (253-1 bytes).
Here is an example how to create a new record and upload multiple files to the example "documents" `file` field using the SDKs:
JavaScript
Dart
`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase'; const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... // create a new record and upload multiple files // (files must be Blob or File instances) const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').create({ title: 'Hello world!', // regular text field 'documents': [ new File(['content 1...'], 'file1.txt'), new File(['content 2...'], 'file2.txt'), ] }); // ----------------------------------------------------------- // Alternative FormData + plain HTML file input example // <input type="file" id="fileInput" /> // ----------------------------------------------------------- const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput'); const formData = new FormData(); // set regular text field formData.append('title', 'Hello world!'); // listen to file input changes and add the selected files to the form data fileInput.addEventListener('change', function () { for (let file of fileInput.files) {     formData.append('documents', file); } }); ... // upload and create new record const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').create(formData);`
`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart'; import 'package:http/http.dart' as http; final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... // create a new record and upload multiple files final record = await pb.collection('example').create(   body: { 'title': 'Hello world!', // regular text field },   files: [ http.MultipartFile.fromString( 'documents', 'example content 1...',       filename: 'file1.txt', ), http.MultipartFile.fromString( 'documents', 'example content 2...',       filename: 'file2.txt', ), ], );`
If your `file` field supports uploading multiple files (aka. **Max Files option is >= 2**) you can use the `+` prefix/suffix field name modifier to respectively prepend/append new files alongside the already uploaded ones. For example:
JavaScript
Dart
`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase'; const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', { "documents+": new File(["content 3..."], "file3.txt") });`
`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart'; import 'package:http/http.dart' as http; final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... final record = await pb.collection('example').update( 'RECORD_ID',   files: [ http.MultipartFile.fromString( 'documents+', 'example content 3...',       filename: 'file3.txt', ), ], );`
###  Deleting files 
To delete uploaded file(s), you could either edit the Record from the Dashboard, or use the API and set the file field to a zero-value (empty string, `[]`).
If you want to **delete individual file(s) from a multiple file upload field** , you could suffix the field name with `-` and specify the filename(s) you want to delete. Here are some examples using the SDKs:
JavaScript
Dart
`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase'; const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... // delete all "documents" files await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', { 'documents': [], }); // delete individual files await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', { 'documents-': ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"], });`
`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart'; final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... // delete all "documents" files await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', body: { 'documents': [], }); // delete individual files await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', body: { 'documents-': ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"], });`
The above examples use the JSON object data format, but you could also use `FormData` instance for _multipart/form-data_ requests. If using `FormData` set the file field to an empty string.
###  File URL 
Each uploaded file could be accessed by requesting its file url: `http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID/FILENAME`
If your file field has the **Thumb sizes** option, you can get a thumb of the image file by adding the `thumb` query parameter to the url like this: `http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID/FILENAME**?thumb=100x300**`_Currently limited to jpg, png, gif (its first frame) and partially webp (stored as png)._
The following thumb formats are currently supported:
  * **WxH** (e.g. 100x300) - crop to WxH viewbox (from center)
  * **WxHt** (e.g. 100x300t) - crop to WxH viewbox (from top)
  * **WxHb** (e.g. 100x300b) - crop to WxH viewbox (from bottom)
  * **WxHf** (e.g. 100x300f) - fit inside a WxH viewbox (without cropping)
  * **0xH** (e.g. 0x300) - resize to H height preserving the aspect ratio
  * **Wx0** (e.g. 100x0) - resize to W width preserving the aspect ratio


The original file would be returned, if the requested thumb size is not found or the file is not an image!
If you already have a Record model instance, the SDKs provide a convenient method to generate a file url by its name.
JavaScript
Dart
`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase'; const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... const record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID'); // get only the first filename from "documents" // // note: // "documents" is an array of filenames because // the "documents" field was created with "Max Files" option > 1; // if "Max Files" was 1, then the result property would be just a string const firstFilename = record.documents[0]; // returns something like: // http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/example/kfzjt5oy8r34hvn/test_52iWbGinWd.png?thumb=100x250 const url = pb.files.getURL(record, firstFilename, {'thumb': '100x250'});`
`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart'; final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... final record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID'); // get only the first filename from "documents" // // note: // "documents" is an array of filenames because // the "documents" field was created with "Max Files" option > 1; // if "Max Files" was 1, then the result property would be just a string final firstFilename = record.getListValue<String>('documents')[0]; // returns something like: // http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/example/kfzjt5oy8r34hvn/test_52iWbGinWd.png?thumb=100x250 final url = pb.files.getURL(record, firstFilename, thumb: '100x250');`
Additionally, to instruct the browser to always download the file instead of showing a preview when accessed directly, you can append the `?download=1` query parameter to the file url.
###  Protected files 
By default all files are public accessible if you know their full url.
For most applications this is fine and reasonably safe because all files have a random part appended to their name, but in some cases you may want an extra security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files like ID card or Passport copies, contracts, etc.
To do this you can mark the `file` field as _Protected_ from its field options in the Dashboard and then request the file with a special **short-lived file token**.
Only requests that satisfy the **View API rule** of the record collection will be able to access or download the protected file(s).
JavaScript
Dart
`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase'; const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... // authenticate await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890'); // generate a file token const fileToken = await pb.files.getToken(); // retrieve an example protected file url (will be valid ~2min) const record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID'); const url = pb.files.getURL(record, record.myPrivateFile, {'token': fileToken});`
`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart'; final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090'); ... // authenticate await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890'); // generate a file token final fileToken = await pb.files.getToken(); // retrieve an example protected file url (will be valid ~2min) final record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID'); final url = pb.files.getURL(record, record.getStringValue('myPrivateFile'), token: fileToken);`
###  Storage options 
By default PocketBase stores uploaded files in the `pb_data/storage` directory on the local file system. For the majority of cases this is usually the recommended storage option because it is very fast, easy to work with and backup.
But if you have limited disk space you could switch to an external S3 compatible storage (AWS S3, MinIO, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, Vultr Object Storage, etc.). The easiest way to setup the connection settings is from the _Dashboard_ > _Settings_ > _Files storage_ :
