LLMs can summarize and otherwise distill desired information from text, including large volumes of text. In many cases, especially when the amount of text is large compared to the size of the model's context window, it can be helpful (or necessary) to break up the summarization task into smaller components.
Iterative refinement represents one strategy for summarizing long texts. The strategy is as follows:
  * Split a text into smaller documents;
  * Summarize the first document;
  * Refine or update the result based on the next document;
  * Repeat through the sequence of documents until finished.


Note that this strategy is not parallelized. It is especially effective when understanding of a sub-document depends on prior context-- for instance, when summarizing a novel or body of text with an inherent sequence.
LangGraph, built on top of `langchain-core`, is well-suited to this problem:
  * LangGraph allows for individual steps (such as successive summarizations) to be streamed, allowing for greater control of execution;
  * LangGraph's checkpointing supports error recovery, extending with human-in-the-loop workflows, and easier incorporation into conversational applications.
  * Because it is assembled from modular components, it is also simple to extend or modify (e.g., to incorporate tool calling or other behavior).


Below, we demonstrate how to summarize text via iterative refinement.
## Load chat model​
Let's first load a chat model:
Select chat model:
Groq▾
* Groq
* OpenAI
* Anthropic
* Azure
* Google Vertex
* AWS
* Cohere
* NVIDIA
* Fireworks AI
* Mistral AI
* Together AI
* IBM watsonx
* Databricks
```
pip install -qU "langchain[groq]"
```

```
import getpassimport osifnot os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"): os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"]= getpass.getpass("Enter API key for Groq: ")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelllm = init_chat_model("llama3-8b-8192", model_provider="groq")
```

## Load documents​
Next, we need some documents to summarize. Below, we generate some toy documents for illustrative purposes. See the document loader how-to guides and integration pages for additional sources of data. The summarization tutorial also includes an example summarizing a blog post.
```
from langchain_core.documents import Documentdocuments =[  Document(page_content="Apples are red", metadata={"title":"apple_book"}),  Document(page_content="Blueberries are blue", metadata={"title":"blueberry_book"}),  Document(page_content="Bananas are yelow", metadata={"title":"banana_book"}),]
```

**API Reference:**Document
## Create graph​
Below we show a LangGraph implementation of this process:
  * We generate a simple chain for the initial summary that plucks out the first document, formats it into a prompt and runs inference with our LLM.
  * We generate a second `refine_summary_chain` that operates on each successive document, refining the initial summary.


We will need to install `langgraph`:
```
pip install -qU langgraph
```

```

```

LangGraph allows the graph structure to be plotted to help visualize its function:
```
from IPython.display import ImageImage(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png())
```

## Invoke graph​
We can step through the execution as follows, printing out the summary as it is refined:
```
asyncfor step in app.astream({"contents":[doc.page_content for doc in documents]},  stream_mode="values",):if summary := step.get("summary"):print(summary)
```

```
Apples are characterized by their red color.Apples are characterized by their red color, while blueberries are known for their blue hue.Apples are characterized by their red color, blueberries are known for their blue hue, and bananas are recognized for their yellow color.
```

The final `step` contains the summary as synthesized from the entire set of documents.
