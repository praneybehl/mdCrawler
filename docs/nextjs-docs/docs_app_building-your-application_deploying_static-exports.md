Building Your ApplicationDeployingStatic Exports
# Static Exports
Next.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.
When running `next build`, Next.js generates an HTML file per route. By breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files, Next.js can avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript code on the client-side, reducing the bundle size and enabling faster page loads.
Since Next.js supports this static export, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.
## Configuration
To enable a static export, change the output mode inside `next.config.js`:
next.config.js
```
/**
 * @type{import('next').NextConfig}
 */
constnextConfig= {
 output:'export',
// Optional: Change links `/me` -> `/me/` and emit `/me.html` -> `/me/index.html`
// trailingSlash: true,
// Optional: Prevent automatic `/me` -> `/me/`, instead preserve `href`
// skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,
// Optional: Change the output directory `out` -> `dist`
// distDir: 'dist',
}
module.exports= nextConfig
```

After running `next build`, Next.js will create an `out` folder with the HTML/CSS/JS assets for your application.
## Supported Features
The core of Next.js has been designed to support static exports.
### Server Components
When you run `next build` to generate a static export, Server Components consumed inside the `app` directory will run during the build, similar to traditional static-site generation.
The resulting component will be rendered into static HTML for the initial page load and a static payload for client navigation between routes. No changes are required for your Server Components when using the static export, unless they consume dynamic server functions.
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
exportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {
// This fetch will run on the server during `next build`
constres=awaitfetch('https://api.example.com/...')
constdata=awaitres.json()
return <main>...</main>
}
```

### Client Components
If you want to perform data fetching on the client, you can use a Client Component with SWR to memoize requests.
app/other/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
'use client'
import useSWR from'swr'
constfetcher= (url:string) =>fetch(url).then((r) =>r.json())
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
const { data,error } =useSWR(
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`,
  fetcher
 )
if (error) return'Failed to load'
if (!data) return'Loading...'
returndata.title
}
```

Since route transitions happen client-side, this behaves like a traditional SPA. For example, the following index route allows you to navigate to different posts on the client:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import Link from'next/link'
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
return (
  <>
   <h1>Index Page</h1>
   <hr />
   <ul>
    <li>
     <Linkhref="/post/1">Post 1</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
     <Linkhref="/post/2">Post 2</Link>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </>
 )
}
```

### Image Optimization
Image Optimization through `next/image` can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in `next.config.js`. For example, you can optimize images with a service like Cloudinary:
next.config.js
```
/** @type{import('next').NextConfig} */
constnextConfig= {
 output:'export',
 images: {
  loader:'custom',
  loaderFile:'./my-loader.ts',
 },
}
module.exports= nextConfig
```

This custom loader will define how to fetch images from a remote source. For example, the following loader will construct the URL for Cloudinary:
my-loader.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
exportdefaultfunctioncloudinaryLoader({
 src,
 width,
 quality,
}: {
 src:string
 width:number
 quality?:number
}) {
constparams= ['f_auto','c_limit',`w_${width}`,`q_${quality ||'auto'}`]
return`https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/${params.join(
','
 )}${src}`
}
```

You can then use `next/image` in your application, defining relative paths to the image in Cloudinary:
app/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import Image from'next/image'
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
return <Imagealt="turtles"src="/turtles.jpg"width={300} height={300} />
}
```

### Route Handlers
Route Handlers will render a static response when running `next build`. Only the `GET` HTTP verb is supported. This can be used to generate static HTML, JSON, TXT, or other files from cached or uncached data. For example:
app/data.json/route.ts
TypeScript
JavaScriptTypeScript
```
exportasyncfunctionGET() {
returnResponse.json({ name:'Lee' })
}
```

The above file `app/data.json/route.ts` will render to a static file during `next build`, producing `data.json` containing `{ name: 'Lee' }`.
If you need to read dynamic values from the incoming request, you cannot use a static export.
### Browser APIs
Client Components are pre-rendered to HTML during `next build`. Because Web APIs like `window`, `localStorage`, and `navigator` are not available on the server, you need to safely access these APIs only when running in the browser. For example:
```
'use client';
import { useEffect } from'react';
exportdefaultfunctionClientComponent() {
useEffect(() => {
// You now have access to `window`
console.log(window.innerHeight);
 }, [])
return...;
}
```

## Unsupported Features
Features that require a Node.js server, or dynamic logic that cannot be computed during the build process, are **not** supported:
  * Dynamic Routes with `dynamicParams: true`
  * Dynamic Routes without `generateStaticParams()`
  * Route Handlers that rely on Request
  * Cookies
  * Rewrites
  * Redirects
  * Headers
  * Middleware
  * Incremental Static Regeneration
  * Image Optimization with the default `loader`
  * Draft Mode
  * Server Actions
  * Intercepting Routes


Attempting to use any of these features with `next dev` will result in an error, similar to setting the `dynamic` option to `error` in the root layout.
```
exportconstdynamic='error'
```

## Deploying
With a static export, Next.js can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.
When running `next build`, Next.js generates the static export into the `out` folder. For example, let's say you have the following routes:
  * `/`
  * `/blog/[id]`


After running `next build`, Next.js will generate the following files:
  * `/out/index.html`
  * `/out/404.html`
  * `/out/blog/post-1.html`
  * `/out/blog/post-2.html`


If you are using a static host like Nginx, you can configure rewrites from incoming requests to the correct files:
nginx.conf
```
server {
 listen 80;
 server_name acme.com;
 root /var/www/out;
location / {
 try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
 }
# This is necessary when `trailingSlash: false`.
# You can omit this when `trailingSlash: true`.
location /blog/ {
rewrite^/blog/(.*)$ /blog/$1.html break;
 }
 error_page 404 /404.html;
location=/404.html {
internal;
 }
}
```
