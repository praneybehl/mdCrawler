Some vibe coding projects run into problems when they don't use proper safety practices. These issues happen when people build things too quickly without testing properly, but they're completely preventable with the right approach.
### Common Problems​
**Getting Stuck in Endless Loops** - Sometimes you ask for a fix, and then another fix, and then another fix, but nothing actually gets better. The code keeps getting more complicated instead of working properly.
**Things Look Like They Work But Don't** - You build a contact form that shows "Message sent!" but no email actually arrives. Or a login system that always says "Welcome!" even with wrong passwords.
**Projects Get Too Messy to Fix** - After adding lots of features quickly, the code becomes so complicated that making any changes breaks other things. Eventually it's easier to start over than to fix problems.
### How Claude Code Prevents These Problems​
**Plan Mode Safety** - You can see what Claude Code will do before it happens. This prevents the endless fix loops because you can stop bad ideas before they make your project worse.
**Documentation That Actually Helps** - Claude Code can document aspects of your project that will help him debug it at a future date. This means when something breaks or you need changes, Claude has the context to fix problems efficiently instead of starting from scratch.
**Real Testing Instead of Fake Results** - You need to test everything yourself with actual data. If you build a contact form, you fill it out and check that emails actually arrive. If you build a login system, you try wrong passwords to make sure they get rejected properly.
**Save Your Work Properly** - When something works, ask Claude Code to commit it to git immediately. This way you can always go back to a working version if new changes break things.
### Simple Rules That Work​
**Test with Real Information and Break Things on Purpose** - Use your actual name, real email addresses, and proper amounts of data instead of "test test test" everywhere. Try submitting forms without filling them out, uploading huge files, and typing special characters. Ask Claude Code to suggest ways normal users might accidentally break your site so you can test those scenarios.
**Use Plan Mode and Strategic Restarts** - Use Plan Mode (`Shift+Tab` twice) to see what Claude Code will do before it happens, especially for important features. If something can't be fixed after 3 tries, start a fresh conversation focusing just on that broken piece. Always commit working features before experimenting with changes.
**Document for Future Claude Sessions** - Ask Claude Code to document aspects of your project that will help him debug it at future dates. Include quirks, special instructions, and how features actually work. Update your `CLAUDE.md` file with lessons learned during development so Claude remembers your preferences.
**Build Bottom-Up with Proven Templates** - Start with simple projects to learn Claude Code patterns before attempting complex applications. Use proven GitHub templates with good documentation and recent activity instead of building everything from scratch. This gives you battle-tested foundations that scale properly.
**Use Git Templates for Safe Experimentation** - Ask Claude Code to set up git properly with frequent commits so you can always go back to working versions. When something works, commit it immediately before trying new features. This lets you experiment freely without fear of breaking what already works.
Build Experience Gradually
Start with simple projects like a basic calculator or weather display before attempting complex applications. Each successful project teaches you what good vibe coding feels like.
##### Problem Prevention Fire
Vibe coding issues burn away when you maintain proper safety practices and testing discipline throughout development. Claude Code's Plan Mode transforms potential disasters into controlled, systematic workflow advantages.
