# Multi-agent network¶
A single agent can usually operate effectively using a handful of tools within a single domain, but even using powerful models like `gpt-4`, it can be less effective at using many tools. 
One way to approach complicated tasks is through a "divide-and-conquer" approach: create a specialized agent for each task or domain and route tasks to the correct "expert". This is an example of a multi-agent network architecture.
This notebook (inspired by the paper AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation, by Wu, et. al.) shows one way to do this using LangGraph.
The resulting graph will look something like the following diagram:
![multi_agent diagram](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/)
Before we get started, a quick note: this and other multi-agent notebooks are designed to show _how_ you can implement certain design patterns in LangGraph. If the pattern suits your needs, we recommend combining it with some of the other fundamental patterns described elsewhere in the docs for best performance.
## Setup¶
First, let's install our required packages and set our API keys:
```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain_community langchain_anthropic langchain_experimental matplotlib langgraph

```

```
importgetpass
importos


def_set_if_undefined(var: str):
  if not os.environ.get(var):
    os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"Please provide your {var}")


_set_if_undefined("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_if_undefined("TAVILY_API_KEY")

```

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development
Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
## Define tools¶
We will also define some tools that our agents will use in the future
```
fromtypingimport Annotated

fromlangchain_community.tools.tavily_searchimport TavilySearchResults
fromlangchain_core.toolsimport tool
fromlangchain_experimental.utilitiesimport PythonREPL

tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)

# Warning: This executes code locally, which can be unsafe when not sandboxed

repl = PythonREPL()


@tool
defpython_repl_tool(
  code: Annotated[str, "The python code to execute to generate your chart."],
):
"""Use this to execute python code. If you want to see the output of a value,
  you should print it out with `print(...)`. This is visible to the user."""
  try:
    result = repl.run(code)
  except BaseException as e:
    return f"Failed to execute. Error: {repr(e)}"
  result_str = f"Successfully executed:\n\`\`\`python\n{code}\n\`\`\`\nStdout: {result}"
  return (
    result_str + "\n\nIf you have completed all tasks, respond with FINAL ANSWER."
  )

```

API Reference: TavilySearchResults | tool | PythonREPL
## Create graph¶
Now that we've defined our tools and made some helper functions, will create the individual agents below and tell them how to talk to each other using LangGraph.
### Define Agent Nodes¶
We now need to define the nodes.
First, we'll create a utility to create a system prompt for each agent.
```
defmake_system_prompt(suffix: str) -> str:
  return (
    "You are a helpful AI assistant, collaborating with other assistants."
    " Use the provided tools to progress towards answering the question."
    " If you are unable to fully answer, that's OK, another assistant with different tools "
    " will help where you left off. Execute what you can to make progress."
    " If you or any of the other assistants have the final answer or deliverable,"
    " prefix your response with FINAL ANSWER so the team knows to stop."
    f"\n{suffix}"
  )

```

```
fromtypingimport Literal

fromlangchain_core.messagesimport BaseMessage, HumanMessage
fromlangchain_anthropicimport ChatAnthropic
fromlanggraph.prebuiltimport create_react_agent
fromlanggraph.graphimport MessagesState, END
fromlanggraph.typesimport Command


llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")


defget_next_node(last_message: BaseMessage, goto: str):
  if "FINAL ANSWER" in last_message.content:
    # Any agent decided the work is done
    return END
  return goto


# Research agent and node
research_agent = create_react_agent(
  llm,
  tools=[tavily_tool],
  prompt=make_system_prompt(
    "You can only do research. You are working with a chart generator colleague."
  ),
)


defresearch_node(
  state: MessagesState,
) -> Command[Literal["chart_generator", END]]:
  result = research_agent.invoke(state)
  goto = get_next_node(result["messages"][-1], "chart_generator")
  # wrap in a human message, as not all providers allow
  # AI message at the last position of the input messages list
  result["messages"][-1] = HumanMessage(
    content=result["messages"][-1].content, name="researcher"
  )
  return Command(
    update={
      # share internal message history of research agent with other agents
      "messages": result["messages"],
    },
    goto=goto,
  )


# Chart generator agent and node
# NOTE: THIS PERFORMS ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION, WHICH CAN BE UNSAFE WHEN NOT SANDBOXED
chart_agent = create_react_agent(
  llm,
  [python_repl_tool],
  prompt=make_system_prompt(
    "You can only generate charts. You are working with a researcher colleague."
  ),
)


defchart_node(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["researcher", END]]:
  result = chart_agent.invoke(state)
  goto = get_next_node(result["messages"][-1], "researcher")
  # wrap in a human message, as not all providers allow
  # AI message at the last position of the input messages list
  result["messages"][-1] = HumanMessage(
    content=result["messages"][-1].content, name="chart_generator"
  )
  return Command(
    update={
      # share internal message history of chart agent with other agents
      "messages": result["messages"],
    },
    goto=goto,
  )

```

API Reference: BaseMessage | HumanMessage | ChatAnthropic | create_react_agent | END | Command
### Define the Graph¶
We can now put it all together and define the graph!
```
fromlanggraph.graphimport StateGraph, START

workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("researcher", research_node)
workflow.add_node("chart_generator", chart_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "researcher")
graph = workflow.compile()

```

API Reference: StateGraph | START
```
fromIPython.displayimport Image, display

try:
  display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
  # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
  pass

```

![](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/)
## Invoke¶
With the graph created, you can invoke it! Let's have it chart some stats for us.
```
events = graph.stream(
  {
    "messages": [
      (
        "user",
        "First, get the UK's GDP over the past 5 years, then make a line chart of it. "
        "Once you make the chart, finish.",
      )
    ],
  },
  # Maximum number of steps to take in the graph
  {"recursion_limit": 150},
)
for s in events:
  print(s)
  print("----")

```

```
