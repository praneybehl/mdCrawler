Event hooks
You can extend the default PocketBase behavior with custom server-side code using the exposed JavaScript app event hooks.
Throwing an error or not calling `e.next()` inside a handler function stops the hook execution chain.
All hook handler functions share the same `function(e){}` signature and expect the user to call `e.next()` if they want to proceed with the execution chain.
###  App hooks 
**onBootstrap**
`onBootstrap` hook is triggered when initializing the main application resources (db, app settings, etc). 
Note that attempting to access the database before the `e.next()` call will result in an error.
`onBootstrap((e) => {   e.next() // e.app })`
**onSettingsReload**
`onSettingsReload` hook is triggered every time when the `$app.settings()` is being replaced with a new state. 
Calling `e.app.settings()` after `e.next()` returns the new state. 
`onSettingsReload((e) => {   e.next() // e.app.settings() })`
**onBackupCreate**
`onBackupCreate` is triggered on each `$app.createBackup` call. 
`onBackupCreate((e) => { // e.app // e.name  - the name of the backup to create // e.exclude - list of pb_data dir entries to exclude from the backup })`
**onBackupRestore**
`onBackupRestore` is triggered before app backup restore (aka. on `$app.restoreBackup` call). 
`onBackupRestore((e) => { // e.app // e.name  - the name of the backup to restore // e.exclude - list of dir entries to exclude from the backup })`
**onTerminate**
`onTerminate` hook is triggered when the app is in the process of being terminated (ex. on `SIGTERM` signal). Note that the app could be terminated abruptly without awaiting the hook completion. 
`onTerminate((e) => { // e.app // e.isRestart })`
###  Mailer hooks 
**onMailerSend**
`onMailerSend` hook is triggered every time when a new email is being send using the `$app.newMailClient()` instance. 
It allows intercepting the email message or to use a custom mailer client.
`onMailerSend((e) => { // e.app // e.mailer // e.message // ex. change the mail subject   e.message.subject = "new subject"   e.next() })`
**onMailerRecordAuthAlertSend**
`onMailerRecordAuthAlertSend` hook is triggered when sending a new device login auth alert email, allowing you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent. 
`onMailerRecordAuthAlertSend((e) => { // e.app // e.mailer // e.message // e.record // e.meta // ex. change the mail subject   e.message.subject = "new subject"   e.next() })`
**onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend**
`onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend` hook is triggered when sending a password reset email to an auth record, allowing you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent. 
`onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend((e) => { // e.app // e.mailer // e.message // e.record // e.meta // ex. change the mail subject   e.message.subject = "new subject"   e.next() })`
**onMailerRecordVerificationSend**
`onMailerRecordVerificationSend` hook is triggered when sending a verification email to an auth record, allowing you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent. 
`onMailerRecordVerificationSend((e) => { // e.app // e.mailer // e.message // e.record // e.meta // ex. change the mail subject   e.message.subject = "new subject"   e.next() })`
**onMailerRecordEmailChangeSend**
`onMailerRecordEmailChangeSend` hook is triggered when sending a confirmation new address email to an auth record, allowing you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent. 
`onMailerRecordEmailChangeSend((e) => { // e.app // e.mailer // e.message // e.record // e.meta // ex. change the mail subject   e.message.subject = "new subject"   e.next() })`
**onMailerRecordOTPSend**
`onMailerRecordOTPSend` hook is triggered when sending an OTP email to an auth record, allowing you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent. 
`onMailerRecordOTPSend((e) => { // e.app // e.mailer // e.message // e.record // e.meta // ex. change the mail subject   e.message.subject = "new subject"   e.next() })`
###  Realtime hooks 
**onRealtimeConnectRequest**
`onRealtimeConnectRequest` hook is triggered when establishing the SSE client connection. 
Any execution after e.next() of a hook handler happens after the client disconnects. 
`onRealtimeConnectRequest((e) => { // e.app // e.client // e.idleTimeout // and all RequestEvent fields...   e.next() })`
**onRealtimeSubscribeRequest**
`onRealtimeSubscribeRequest` hook is triggered when updating the client subscriptions, allowing you to further validate and modify the submitted change. 
`onRealtimeSubscribeRequest((e) => { // e.app // e.client // e.subscriptions // and all RequestEvent fields...   e.next() })`
**onRealtimeMessageSend**
`onRealtimeMessageSend` hook is triggered when sending an SSE message to a client. 
`onRealtimeMessageSend((e) => { // e.app // e.client // e.message // and all original connect RequestEvent fields...   e.next() })`
###  Record model hooks 
These are lower level Record model hooks and could be triggered from anywhere (custom console command, scheduled cron job, when calling `e.save(record)`, etc.) and therefore they have no access to the request context!
If you want to intercept the builtin Web APIs and to access their request body, query parameters, headers or the request auth state, then please use the designated Record `*Request` hooks .
**onRecordEnrich**
`onRecordEnrich` is triggered every time when a record is enriched - as part of the builtin Record responses, during realtime message serialization, or when `apis.enrichRecord` is invoked. 
It could be used for example to redact/hide or add computed temporary Record model props only for the specific request info. 
`onRecordEnrich((e) => { // hide one or more fields   e.record.hide("role") // add new custom field for registered users if (e.requestInfo.auth?.collection()?.name == "users") {     e.record.withCustomData(true) // for security custom props require to be enabled explicitly     e.record.set("computedScore", e.record.get("score") * e.requestInfo.auth.get("base")) }   e.next() }, "posts")`
**onRecordValidate**
`onRecordValidate` is a Record proxy model hook of `onModelValidate`. 
`onRecordValidate` is called every time when a Record is being validated, e.g. triggered by `$app.validate()` or `$app.save()`. 
`// fires for every record onRecordValidate((e) => { // e.app // e.record   e.next() }) // fires only for "users" and "articles" records onRecordValidate((e) => { // e.app // e.record   e.next() }, "users", "articles")`

Operations AFTER the `e.next()` execute after the Record validation and the INSERT DB statement. 
Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Record is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may not have been committed yet. If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can bind to `onRecordAfterCreateSuccess` or `onRecordAfterCreateError` hooks. 
`// fires for every record onRecordCreate((e) => { // e.app // e.record   e.next() }) // fires only for "users" and "articles" records onRecordCreate((e) => { // e.app // e.record   e.next() }, "users", "articles")`

**onModelValidate**
`onModelValidate` is called every time when a Model is being validated, e.g. triggered by `$app.validate()` or `$app.save()`. 
For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks. 
`// fires for every model onModelValidate((e) => { // e.app // e.model   e.next() }) // fires only for "users" and "articles" models onModelValidate((e) => { // e.app // e.model   e.next() }, "users", "articles")`

Operations BEFORE the `e.next()` execute before the Model validation and the INSERT DB statement. 
Operations AFTER the `e.next()` execute after the Model validation and the INSERT DB statement. 
Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may not have been committed yet. If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can bind to `onModelAfterCreateSuccess` or `onModelAfterCreateError` hooks. 
For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.
