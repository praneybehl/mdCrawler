## Detailed Plan Breakdown​
### Claude Free - Limited Testing​
The free plan provides limited Sonnet access for basic usage only, with very low usage limits that are quickly exhausted. The free plan does not support Claude Code access. You need at least a Pro subscription or API credits to use Claude Code.
### Claude Pro ($17/month annually, $20/month monthly) - Light Development​
Claude Pro includes access to Claude 4 Sonnet model with 5x usage limits compared to the free tier. However, it lacks access to the advanced Claude 4 Opus model. For Claude Code, this plan works well for light development, small projects, and learning, though you may hit usage limits with extensive coding sessions and won't have access to Opus, the most powerful model. Annual billing saves $36 per year compared to monthly billing.
**Best For:**
  * **Learning Claude Code** - Affordable way to get started
  * **Hobby projects** - Small personal development work
  * **Occasional use** - Not daily development workflow
  * **Budget constraints** - Cost-effective entry point


### Claude Max $100 ($100/month) - Professional Development with Limited Opus​
Claude Max $100 provides access to Claude 4 Sonnet with 5x higher usage limits than Pro, plus limited access to the advanced Claude 4 Opus model. For Claude Code, it handles professional development with moderate to large projects, extended coding sessions, and occasional access to Opus for complex analysis when needed.
**Best For:**
  * **Professional developers** - Regular Claude Code usage with occasional complex needs
  * **Medium projects** - Projects that need some advanced analysis but not constantly
  * **Budget-conscious professionals** - Want Opus access without full Max cost


### Claude Max $200 ($200/month) - Full Professional Development​
Claude Max provides access to all Claude models including the advanced Claude 4 Opus, with 20x higher usage limits than Pro. For Claude Code, this plan handles professional development with large projects and complex tasks, extended coding sessions without hitting limits, and full access to Opus for architectural decisions and complex analysis.
**Best For:**
  * **Professional developers** - Daily Claude Code usage who want the best model
  * **Large projects** - Complex codebases and architecture work
  * **Maximum productivity** - Unrestricted Claude Code workflow


## API Pricing - Pay-Per-Use​
### Current API Rates (June 2025)​
Model| Input Tokens| Output Tokens| Best For  
---|---|---|---  
Claude 4 Opus| $15.00 / 1M| $75.00 / 1M| Complex reasoning, architecture  
Claude 4 Sonnet| $3.00 / 1M| $15.00 / 1M| Daily development, balanced use  
Claude 3.5 Sonnet| $3.00 / 1M| $15.00 / 1M| Cost-effective development  
Claude 3.5 Haiku| $0.80 / 1M| $4.00 / 1M| Simple tasks, high volume  
**API Benefits:** The API provides precise cost control by charging only for actual usage, with access to all models including latest releases and no usage limits for scaling as needed. Enterprise features and custom configurations are also available.
**API Considerations:** However, costs can be variable and expensive with heavy usage, requiring monitoring of token usage and billing complexity.
## Usage Monitoring and Optimization​
### Track Your Usage​
**For Subscription Users:**
  * **CC Usage Tool:** Install ccusage for detailed tracking
  * **Monitor patterns:** Understand your typical monthly usage
  * **Optimize workflow:** Use appropriate models for different tasks


**For API Users:**
  * **Anthropic Console:** Monitor usage at console.anthropic.com
  * **Set alerts:** Configure billing alerts to avoid surprises
  * **Token optimization:** Use efficient prompting to reduce costs


### Cost Optimization Tips​
For model selection strategy, use Sonnet 4 for daily development work as it provides the best balance of capability and cost. Switch to Opus only when you need complex analysis or architectural decisions. Use Haiku for simple, repetitive tasks to save costs, and try to batch similar tasks together to maximize efficiency.
For usage efficiency, employ strategic compacting with the `/compact` command to manage context costs, plan your sessions to minimize redundant processing, and use the `/model` command to switch between models and optimize cost per task type.
