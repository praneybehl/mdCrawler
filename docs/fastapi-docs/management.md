# Repository Management¶
Here's a short description of how the FastAPI repository is managed and maintained.
## Owner¶
I, @tiangolo, am the creator and owner of the FastAPI repository. 🤓
I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I'm the BDFL. 😅
## Team¶
There's a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎
They have different levels of permissions and specific instructions.
Some of the tasks they can perform include:
  * Adding labels to PRs.
  * Editing PR titles.
  * Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.
  * Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.
  * Merge some specific types of PRs.


You can see the current team members in FastAPI People - Team.
Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.
## FastAPI Experts¶
The people that help others the most in GitHub Discussions can become **FastAPI Experts**.
This is normally the best way to contribute to the project.
## External Contributions¶
External contributions are very welcome and appreciated, including answering questions, submitting PRs, etc. 🙇‍♂️
There are many ways to help maintain FastAPI.
