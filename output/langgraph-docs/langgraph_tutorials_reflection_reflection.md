# Reflection¶
In the context of LLM agent building, reflection refers to the process of prompting an LLM to observe its past steps (along with potential observations from tools/the environment) to assess the quality of the chosen actions. This is then used downstream for things like re-planning, search, or evaluation.

## Conclusion¶
Now that you've applied reflection to an LLM agent, I'll note one thing: self-reflection is inherently cyclic: it is much more effective if the reflection step has additional context or feedback (from tool observations, checks, etc.). If, like in the scenario above, the reflection step simply prompts the LLM to reflect on its output, it can still benefit the output quality (since the LLM then has multiple "shots" at getting a good output), but it's less guaranteed.
