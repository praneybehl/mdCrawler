Migrations
PocketBase comes with a builtin DB and data migration utility, allowing you to version your DB structure, create collections programmatically, initialize default settings and/or run anything that needs to be executed only once.
The user defined migrations are located in `pb_migrations` directory (it can be changed using the `--migrationsDir` flag) and each unapplied migration inside it will be executed automatically in a transaction on `serve` (or on `migrate up`).
The generated migrations are safe to be committed to version control and can be shared with your other team members.
###  Automigrate 
The prebuilt executable has the `--automigrate` flag enabled by default, meaning that every collection configuration change from the Dashboard (or Web API) will generate the related migration file automatically for you.
###  Creating migrations 
To create a new blank migration you can run `migrate create`.
`[root@dev app]$ ./pocketbase migrate create "your_new_migration"`
`// pb_migrations/1687801097_your_new_migration.js migrate((app) => { // add up queries... }, (app) => { // add down queries... })`
New migrations are applied automatically on `serve`.
Optionally, you could apply new migrations manually by running `migrate up`. To revert the last applied migration(s), you could run `migrate down [number]`. When manually applying or reverting migrations, the `serve` process needs to be restarted so that it can refresh its cached collections state.
#####  Migration file 
Each migration file should have a single `migrate(upFunc, downFunc)` call.
In the migration file, you are expected to write your "upgrade" code in the `upFunc` callback. The `downFunc` is optional and it should contain the "downgrade" operations to revert the changes made by the `upFunc`.
Both callbacks accept a transactional `app` instance.
###  Collections snapshot 
The `migrate collections` command generates a full snapshot of your current collections configuration without having to type it manually. Similar to the `migrate create` command, this will generate a new migration file in the `pb_migrations` directory.
`[root@dev app]$ ./pocketbase migrate collections`
By default the collections snapshot is imported in _extend_ mode, meaning that collections and fields that don't exist in the snapshot are preserved. If you want the snapshot to _delete_ missing collections and fields, you can edit the generated file and change the last argument of `importCollections` to `true`.
###  Migrations history 
All applied migration filenames are stored in the internal `_migrations` table. During local development often you might end up making various collection changes to test different approaches. When `--automigrate` is enabled (_which is the default_) this could lead in a migration history with unnecessary intermediate steps that may not be wanted in the final migration history.
To avoid the clutter and to prevent applying the intermediate steps in production, you can remove (or squash) the unnecessary migration files manually and then update the local migrations history by running:
`[root@dev app]$ ./pocketbase migrate history-sync`
The above command will remove any entry from the `_migrations` table that doesn't have a related migration file associated with it.
###  Examples 
#####  Executing raw SQL statements 
`// pb_migrations/1687801090_set_pending_status.js migrate((app) => {   app.db().newQuery("UPDATE articles SET status = 'pending' WHERE status = ''").execute() })`
#####  Initialize default application settings 
`// pb_migrations/1687801090_initial_settings.js migrate((app) => { let settings = app.settings() // for all available settings fields you could check // /jsvm/interfaces/core.Settings.html   settings.meta.appName = "test"   settings.meta.appURL = "https://example.com"   settings.logs.maxDays = 2   settings.logs.logAuthId = true   settings.logs.logIP = false   app.save(settings) })`
#####  Creating initial superuser 
_For all supported record methods, you can refer toRecord operations_ .
`// pb_migrations/1687801090_initial_superuser.js migrate((app) => { let superusers = app.findCollectionByNameOrId("_superusers") let record = new Record(superusers) // note: the values can be eventually loaded via $os.getenv(key) // or from a special local config file   record.set("email", "test@example.com")   record.set("password", "1234567890")   app.save(record) }, (app) => { // optional revert operation try { let record = app.findAuthRecordByEmail("_superusers", "test@example.com")     app.delete(record) } catch { // silent errors (probably already deleted) } })`
#####  Creating collection programmatically 
_For all supported collection methods, you can refer toCollection operations_ .
`// migrations/1687801090_create_clients_collection.js migrate((app) => { // missing default options, system fields like id, email, etc. are initialized automatically // and will be merged with the provided configuration let collection = new Collection({ type: "auth", name: "clients", listRule: "id = @request.auth.id", viewRule: "id = @request.auth.id", fields: [ { type: "text", name: "company", required: true, max: 100, }, { name: "url", type: "url", presentable: true, }, ], passwordAuth: { enabled: false, }, otp: { enabled: true, }, indexes: [ "CREATE INDEX idx_clients_company ON clients (company)" ], })   app.save(collection) }, (app) => { let collection = app.findCollectionByNameOrId("clients")   app.delete(collection) })`
