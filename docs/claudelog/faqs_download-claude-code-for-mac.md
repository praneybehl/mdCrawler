Claude Code works natively on macOS with excellent Terminal integration. Installation is straightforward via `npm` with automatic PATH configuration for global access.
### Quick Installation​
**Open Terminal and run:**
```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Configure authentication:**
```
claude config
```

I find the macOS Terminal provides an excellent Claude Code experience with good integration with development workflows.
### Prerequisites​
**Node.js Installation** - Install Node.js 18.0+ via Homebrew (recommended):
```
# Install Homebrew if needed/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"# Install Node.jsbrew install node
```

**System Requirements:**
  * macOS (with Node.js support)
  * Node.js 18.0 or higher
  * Active internet connection


### macOS Features​
**Terminal Integration** - Native support for Terminal features and notifications.
**Permissions** - macOS may prompt for developer tool permissions during first use.
### Configuration​
**Config Location** - Settings stored in `~/.claude/settings.json` in your home directory.
**Global Access** - Claude Code installs globally via npm for system-wide terminal access.
### Permission Issues​
If you encounter permission errors during installation:
```
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Or configure npm to avoid sudo requirements for global packages.
Homebrew Recommended
Use Homebrew to install Node.js for easier version management and better integration with macOS development tools.
##### Mac Terminal Excellence!
Mac users get the smoothest Claude Code experience out of the box! The Terminal integration is particularly elegant on macOS - you're in for a treat.
