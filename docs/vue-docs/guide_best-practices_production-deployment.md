# Production Deployment ​
## Development vs. Production ​
During development, Vue provides a number of features to improve the development experience:
  * Warning for common errors and pitfalls
  * Props / events validation
  * Reactivity debugging hooks
  * Devtools integration


However, these features become useless in production. Some of the warning checks can also incur a small amount of performance overhead. When deploying to production, we should drop all the unused, development-only code branches for smaller payload size and better performance.
## Without Build Tools ​
If you are using Vue without a build tool by loading it from a CDN or self-hosted script, make sure to use the production build (dist files that end in `.prod.js`) when deploying to production. Production builds are pre-minified with all development-only code branches removed.
  * If using global build (accessing via the `Vue` global): use `vue.global.prod.js`.
  * If using ESM build (accessing via native ESM imports): use `vue.esm-browser.prod.js`.


Consult the dist file guide for more details.
## With Build Tools ​
Projects scaffolded via `create-vue` (based on Vite) or Vue CLI (based on webpack) are pre-configured for production builds.
If using a custom setup, make sure that:
  1. `vue` resolves to `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`.
  2. The compile time feature flags are properly configured.
  3. `process.env.NODE_ENV` is replaced with `"production"` during build.

## Tracking Runtime Errors ​
The app-level error handler can be used to report errors to tracking services:
js```
import { createApp } from 'vue'
const app = createApp(...)
app.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {
 // report error to tracking services
}
```

Services such as Sentry and Bugsnag also provide official integrations for Vue.
