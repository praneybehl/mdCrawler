Crawl4AI is the #1 trending GitHub repository, actively maintained by a vibrant community. It delivers blazing-fast, AI-ready web crawling tailored for large language models, AI agents, and data pipelines. Fully open source, flexible, and built for real-time performance, **Crawl4AI** empowers developers with unmatched speed, precision, and deployment ease.
> **Note** : If you're looking for the old documentation, you can access it here.
## Quick Start
Here's a quick example to show you how easy it is to use Crawl4AI with its asynchronous capabilities:
```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
async def main():
  # Create an instance of AsyncWebCrawler
  async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Run the crawler on a URL
    result = await crawler.arun(url="https://crawl4ai.com")
    # Print the extracted content
    print(result.markdown)
# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())

```

## What Does Crawl4AI Do?
Crawl4AI is a feature-rich crawler and scraper that aims to:
1. **Generate Clean Markdown** : Perfect for RAG pipelines or direct ingestion into LLMs. 2. **Structured Extraction** : Parse repeated patterns with CSS, XPath, or LLM-based extraction. 3. **Advanced Browser Control** : Hooks, proxies, stealth modes, session re-use—fine-grained control. 4. **High Performance** : Parallel crawling, chunk-based extraction, real-time use cases. 5. **Open Source** : No forced API keys, no paywalls—everyone can access their data. 
**Core Philosophies** : - **Democratize Data** : Free to use, transparent, and highly configurable. - **LLM Friendly** : Minimally processed, well-structured text, images, and metadata, so AI models can easily consume it.
