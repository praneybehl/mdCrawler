# Reasoning without Observation¶
In ReWOO, Xu, et. al, propose an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:
  1. Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass. (_ReACT-style agent architecture requires many LLM calls with redundant prefixes (since the system prompt and previous steps are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step_)
  2. Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking the tools (in theory).


The following diagram outlines ReWOO's overall computation graph:
![ReWoo Diagram](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rewoo/rewoo/)
ReWOO is made of 3 modules:
  1. 🧠**Planner** : Generate the plan in the following format: 
```
Plan: <reasoning>
#E1 = Tool[argument for tool]
Plan: <reasoning>
#E2 = Tool[argument for tool with #E1 variable substitution]
...

```

  2. **Worker** : executes the tool with the provided arguments.
  3. 🧠**Solver** : generates the answer for the initial task based on the tool observations.


The modules with a 🧠 emoji depend on an LLM call. Notice that we avoid redundant calls to the planner LLM by using variable substitution.
In this example, each module is represented by a LangGraph node. The end result will leave a trace that looks like this one. Let's get started!
## Setup¶
For this example, we will provide the agent with a Tavily search engine tool. You can get an API key here or replace with a free tool option (e.g., duck duck go search).
Let's install the required packages and set our API keys
```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_community langchain_openai tavily-python

```

```
importgetpass
importos


def_set_if_undefined(var: str):
  if not os.environ.get(var):
    os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}=")


_set_if_undefined("TAVILY_API_KEY")
_set_if_undefined("OPENAI_API_KEY")

```

## Define graph state¶
In LangGraph, every node updates a shared graph state. The state is the input to any node whenever it is invoked.
Below, we will define a state dict to contain the task, plan, steps, and other variables.
```
fromtypingimport List
fromtyping_extensionsimport TypedDict


classReWOO(TypedDict):
  task: str
  plan_string: str
  steps: List
  results: dict
  result: str

```

## Planner¶
The planner prompts an LLM to generate a plan in the form of a task list. The arguments to each task are strings that may contain special variables (`#E{0-9}+`) that are used for variable substitution from other task results.
![ReWOO workflow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rewoo/rewoo/)
Our example agent will have two tools: 1. Google - a search engine (in this case Tavily) 2. LLM - an LLM call to reason about previous outputs.
The LLM tool receives less of the prompt context and so can be more token-efficient than the ReACT paradigm.
```
fromlangchain_openaiimport ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

```

API Reference: ChatOpenAI
```
prompt = """For the following task, make plans that can solve the problem step by step. For each plan, indicate \
which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a \
variable #E that can be called by later tools. (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, Plan, ...)

Tools can be one of the following:
(1) Google[input]: Worker that searches results from Google. Useful when you need to find short
and succinct answers about a specific topic. The input should be a search query.
(2) LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general
world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem
yourself. Input can be any instruction.

For example,
Task: Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week. Thomas worked x
hours. Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours
less than Toby. How many hours did Rebecca work?
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve
with Wolfram Alpha. #E1 = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x − 10) + ((2x − 10) − 8) = 157]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked. #E2 = LLM[What is x, given #E1]
Plan: Calculate the number of hours Rebecca worked. #E3 = Calculator[(2 ∗ #E2 − 10) − 8]

Begin! 
Describe your plans with rich details. Each Plan should be followed by only one #E.

Task: {task}"""

```

```
task = "what is the exact hometown of the 2024 mens australian open winner"

```

```
result = model.invoke(prompt.format(task=task))

```

```
print(result.content)

```

```
Plan: Use Google to search for the 2024 Australian Open winner.
#E1 = Google[2024 Australian Open winner]

Plan: Retrieve the name of the 2024 Australian Open winner from the search results.
#E2 = LLM[What is the name of the 2024 Australian Open winner, given #E1]

Plan: Use Google to search for the hometown of the 2024 Australian Open winner.
#E3 = Google[hometown of 2024 Australian Open winner, given #E2]

Plan: Retrieve the hometown of the 2024 Australian Open winner from the search results.
#E4 = LLM[What is the hometown of the 2024 Australian Open winner, given #E3]

```

#### Planner Node¶
To connect the planner to our graph, we will create a `get_plan` node that accepts the `ReWOO` state and returns with a state update for the `steps` and `plan_string` fields.
```
importre

fromlangchain_core.promptsimport ChatPromptTemplate

# Regex to match expressions of the form E#... = ...[...]
regex_pattern = r"Plan:\s*(.+)\s*(#E\d+)\s*=\s*(\w+)\s*\[([^\]]+)\]"
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("user", prompt)])
planner = prompt_template | model


defget_plan(state: ReWOO):
  task = state["task"]
  result = planner.invoke({"task": task})
  # Find all matches in the sample text
  matches = re.findall(regex_pattern, result.content)
  return {"steps": matches, "plan_string": result.content}

```

API Reference: ChatPromptTemplate
## Executor¶
The executor receives the plan and executes the tools in sequence.
Below, instantiate the search engine and define the tool execution node.
```
fromlangchain_community.tools.tavily_searchimport TavilySearchResults

search = TavilySearchResults()

```

API Reference: TavilySearchResults
```
def_get_current_task(state: ReWOO):
  if "results" not in state or state["results"] is None:
    return 1
  if len(state["results"]) == len(state["steps"]):
    return None
  else:
    return len(state["results"]) + 1


deftool_execution(state: ReWOO):
"""Worker node that executes the tools of a given plan."""
  _step = _get_current_task(state)
  _, step_name, tool, tool_input = state["steps"][_step - 1]
  _results = (state["results"] or {}) if "results" in state else {}
  for k, v in _results.items():
    tool_input = tool_input.replace(k, v)
  if tool == "Google":
    result = search.invoke(tool_input)
  elif tool == "LLM":
    result = model.invoke(tool_input)
  else:
    raise ValueError
  _results[step_name] = str(result)
  return {"results": _results}

```

## Solver¶
The solver receives the full plan and generates the final response based on the responses of the tool calls from the worker.
```
solve_prompt = """Solve the following task or problem. To solve the problem, we have made step-by-step Plan and \
retrieved corresponding Evidence to each Plan. Use them with caution since long evidence might \
contain irrelevant information.

{plan}

Now solve the question or task according to provided Evidence above. Respond with the answer
directly with no extra words.

Task: {task}
Response:"""


defsolve(state: ReWOO):
  plan = ""
  for _plan, step_name, tool, tool_input in state["steps"]:
    _results = (state["results"] or {}) if "results" in state else {}
    for k, v in _results.items():
      tool_input = tool_input.replace(k, v)
      step_name = step_name.replace(k, v)
    plan += f"Plan: {_plan}\n{step_name} = {tool}[{tool_input}]"
  prompt = solve_prompt.format(plan=plan, task=state["task"])
  result = model.invoke(prompt)
  return {"result": result.content}

```

## Define Graph¶
Our graph defines the workflow. Each of the planner, tool executor, and solver modules are added as nodes.
```
def_route(state):
  _step = _get_current_task(state)
  if _step is None:
    # We have executed all tasks
    return "solve"
  else:
    # We are still executing tasks, loop back to the "tool" node
    return "tool"

```

```
fromlanggraph.graphimport END, StateGraph, START

graph = StateGraph(ReWOO)
graph.add_node("plan", get_plan)
graph.add_node("tool", tool_execution)
graph.add_node("solve", solve)
graph.add_edge("plan", "tool")
graph.add_edge("solve", END)
graph.add_conditional_edges("tool", _route)
graph.add_edge(START, "plan")

app = graph.compile()

```

API Reference: END | StateGraph | START

## Conclusion¶
Congratulations on implementing ReWOO! Before you leave, I'll leave you with a couple limitations of the current implementation from the paper:
  1. If little context of the environment is available, the planner will be ineffective in its tool use. This can typically be ameliorated through few-shot prompting and/or fine-tuning.
  2. The tasks are still executed in sequence, meaning the total execution time is impacted by _every_ tool call, not just the longest-running in a given step.
