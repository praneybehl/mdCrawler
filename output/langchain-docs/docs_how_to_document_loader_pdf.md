Portable Document Format (PDF), standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.
This guide covers how to load `PDF` documents into the LangChain Document format that we use downstream.
Text in PDFs is typically represented via text boxes. They may also contain images. A PDF parser might do some combination of the following:
  * Agglomerate text boxes into lines, paragraphs, and other structures via heuristics or ML inference;
  * Run OCR on images to detect text therein;
  * Classify text as belonging to paragraphs, lists, tables, or other structures;
  * Structure text into table rows and columns, or key-value pairs.


LangChain integrates with a host of PDF parsers. Some are simple and relatively low-level; others will support OCR and image-processing, or perform advanced document layout analysis. The right choice will depend on your needs. Below we enumerate the possibilities.
We will demonstrate these approaches on a sample file:
```
file_path =("../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```

A note on multimodal models
Many modern LLMs support inference over multimodal inputs (e.g., images). In some applications -- such as question-answering over PDFs with complex layouts, diagrams, or scans -- it may be advantageous to skip the PDF parsing, instead casting a PDF page to an image and passing it to a model directly. We demonstrate an example of this in the Use of multimodal models section below.
## Simple and fast text extraction​
If you are looking for a simple string representation of text that is embedded in a PDF, the method below is appropriate. It will return a list of Document objects-- one per page-- containing a single string of the page's text in the Document's `page_content` attribute. It will not parse text in images or scanned PDF pages. Under the hood it uses the pypdf Python library.
LangChain document loaders implement `lazy_load` and its async variant, `alazy_load`, which return iterators of `Document` objects. We will use these below.
```
%pip install -qU pypdf
```

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoaderloader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)pages =[]asyncfor page in loader.alazy_load():  pages.append(page)
```

**API Reference:**PyPDFLoader
```
print(f"{pages[0].metadata}\n")print(pages[0].page_content)
```

```

Note that the metadata of each document stores the corresponding page number.
### Vector search over PDFs​
Once we have loaded PDFs into LangChain `Document` objects, we can index them (e.g., a RAG application) in the usual way. Below we use OpenAI embeddings, although any LangChain embeddings model will suffice.
```
%pip install -qU langchain-openai
```

```
import getpassimport osif"OPENAI_API_KEY"notin os.environ:  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]= getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

```

## Layout analysis and extraction of text from images​
If you require a more granular segmentation of text (e.g., into distinct paragraphs, titles, tables, or other structures) or require extraction of text from images, the method below is appropriate. It will return a list of Document objects, where each object represents a structure on the page. The Document's metadata stores the page number and other information related to the object (e.g., it might store table rows and columns in the case of a table object).
Under the hood it uses the `langchain-unstructured` library. See the integration docs for more information about using Unstructured with LangChain.
Unstructured supports multiple parameters for PDF parsing:
  * `strategy` (e.g., `"fast"` or `"hi-res"`)
  * API or local processing. You will need an API key to use the API.


The hi-res strategy provides support for document layout analysis and OCR. We demonstrate it below via the API. See local parsing section below for considerations when running locally.
```
%pip install -qU langchain-unstructured
```

```
import getpassimport osif"UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"notin os.environ:  os.environ["UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"]= getpass.getpass("Unstructured API Key:")
```

```
Unstructured API Key: ········
```

As before, we initialize a loader and load documents lazily:
```
from langchain_unstructured import UnstructuredLoaderloader = UnstructuredLoader(  file_path=file_path,  strategy="hi_res",  partition_via_api=True,  coordinates=True,)docs =[]for doc in loader.lazy_load():  docs.append(doc)
```

**API Reference:**UnstructuredLoader
```
INFO: Preparing to split document for partition.INFO: Starting page number set to 1INFO: Allow failed set to 0INFO: Concurrency level set to 5INFO: Splitting pages 1 to 16 (16 total)INFO: Determined optimal split size of 4 pages.INFO: Partitioning 4 files with 4 page(s) each.INFO: Partitioning set #1 (pages 1-4).INFO: Partitioning set #2 (pages 5-8).INFO: Partitioning set #3 (pages 9-12).INFO: Partitioning set #4 (pages 13-16).INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"INFO: Successfully partitioned set #1, elements added to the final result.INFO: Successfully partitioned set #2, elements added to the final result.INFO: Successfully partitioned set #3, elements added to the final result.INFO: Successfully partitioned set #4, elements added to the final result.
```

Here we recover 171 distinct structures over the 16 page document:
```
print(len(docs))
```

```
171
```

We can use the document metadata to recover content from a single page:
```
first_page_docs =[doc for doc in docs if doc.metadata.get("page_number")==1]for doc in first_page_docs:print(doc.page_content)
```

```

### Extracting tables and other structures​
Each `Document` we load represents a structure, like a title, paragraph, or table.
Some structures may be of special interest for indexing or question-answering tasks. These structures may be:
  1. Classified for easy identification;
  2. Parsed into a more structured representation.


Below, we identify and extract a table:

LayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA5Table 1: Current layout detection models in the LayoutParser model zooDataset Base Model1 Large Model Notes PubLayNet [38] PRImA [3] Newspaper [17] TableBank [18] HJDataset [31] F / M M F F F / M M - - F - Layouts of modern scientiﬁc documents Layouts of scanned modern magazines and scientiﬁc reports Layouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century Table region on modern scientiﬁc and business document Layouts of history Japanese documents1 For each dataset, we train several models of diﬀerent sizes for diﬀerent needs (the trade-oﬀ between accuracy vs. computational cost). For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101 backbones [13], respectively. One can train models of diﬀerent architectures, like Faster R-CNN [28] (F) and Mask R-CNN [12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained using the ResNet 101 backbone. The platform is maintained and a number of additions will be made to the model zoo in coming months.layout data structures, which are optimized for eﬃciency and versatility. 3) When necessary, users can employ existing or customized OCR models via the uniﬁed API provided in the OCR module. 4) LayoutParser comes with a set of utility functions for the visualization and storage of the layout data. 5) LayoutParser is also highly customizable, via its integration with functions for layout data annotation and model training. We now provide detailed descriptions for each component.3.1 Layout Detection ModelsIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and generates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent from traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather than manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an object detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and makes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection. LayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can perform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:1 import layoutparser as lp 2 image = cv2 . imread ( " image_file " ) # load images 3 model = lp . De t e c tro n2 Lay outM odel ( " lp :// PubLayNet / f as t er _ r c nn _ R _ 50 _ F P N_ 3 x / config " ) 4 5 layout = model . detect ( image )LayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various datasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to domain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap- plied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As document structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax is used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset name and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.
```

Note that although the table text is collapsed into a single string in the document's content, the metadata contains a representation of its rows and columns:
```
from IPython.display import HTML, displaysegments =[  doc.metadatafor doc in docsif doc.metadata.get("page_number")==5and doc.metadata.get("category")=="Table"]display(HTML(segments[0]["text_as_html"]))
```

### Extracting text from specific sections​
Structures may have parent-child relationships -- for example, a paragraph might belong to a section with a title. If a section is of particular interest (e.g., for indexing) we can isolate the corresponding `Document` objects.
Below, we extract all text associated with the document's "Conclusion" section:
```
render_page(docs,14, print_text=False)
```

![](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/)
```
conclusion_docs =[]parent_id =-1for doc in docs:if doc.metadata["category"]=="Title"and"Conclusion"in doc.page_content:    parent_id = doc.metadata["element_id"]if doc.metadata.get("parent_id")== parent_id:    conclusion_docs.append(doc)for doc in conclusion_docs:print(doc.page_content)
```

```
LayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document image analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to build ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated structures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and training of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser community platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting discussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser team is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing the most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document modeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.Acknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

### Extracting text from images​
OCR is run on images, enabling the extraction of text therein:

```
LayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIAfocuses on precision, eﬃciency, and robustness. The target documents may have complicated structures, and may require training multiple layout detection models to achieve the optimal accuracy. Light-weight pipelines are built for relatively simple documents, with an emphasis on development ease, speed and ﬂexibility. Ideally one only needs to use existing resources, and model training should be avoided. Through two exemplar projects, we show how practitioners in both academia and industry can easily build such pipelines using LayoutParser and extract high-quality structured document data for their downstream tasks. The source code for these projects will be publicly available in the LayoutParser community hub.115.1 A Comprehensive Historical Document Digitization PipelineThe digitization of historical documents can unlock valuable data that can shed light on many important social, economic, and historical questions. Yet due to scan noises, page wearing, and the prevalence of complicated layout structures, ob- taining a structured representation of historical document scans is often extremely complicated. In this example, LayoutParser was used to develop a comprehensive pipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener- ate high-quality structured data from historical Japanese ﬁrm ﬁnancial ta- bles with complicated layouts. The pipeline applies two layout models to identify diﬀerent levels of document structures and two customized OCR engines for optimized character recog- nition accuracy.‘Active Learning Layout Annotate Layout Dataset | +—— Annotation Toolkit A4 Deep Learning Layout Layout Detection Model Training & Inference, A Post-processing — Handy Data Structures & \ Lo orajport 7 ) Al Pls for Layout Data A4 Default and Customized Text Recognition 0CR Models ¥ Visualization & Export Layout Structure Visualization & Storage The Japanese Document Helpful LayoutParser Modules Digitization PipelineAs shown in Figure 4 (a), the document contains columns of text written vertically 15, a common style in Japanese. Due to scanning noise and archaic printing technology, the columns can be skewed or have vari- able widths, and hence cannot be eas- ily identiﬁed via rule-based methods. Within each column, words are sepa- rated by white spaces of variable size, and the vertical positions of objects can be an indicator of their layout type.Fig. 5: Illustration of how LayoutParser helps with the historical document digi- tization pipeline.15 A document page consists of eight rows like this. For simplicity we skip the row segmentation discussion and refer readers to the source code when available.
```

Note that the text from the figure on the right is extracted and incorporated into the content of the `Document`.
### Local parsing​
Parsing locally requires the installation of additional dependencies.
**Poppler** (PDF analysis)
  * Linux: `apt-get install poppler-utils`
  * Mac: `brew install poppler`
  * Windows: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows


**Tesseract** (OCR)
  * Linux: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
  * Mac: `brew install tesseract`
  * Windows: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-installer-for-windows


We will also need to install the `unstructured` PDF extras:
```
%pip install -qU "unstructured[pdf]"
```

We can then use the UnstructuredLoader much the same way, forgoing the API key and `partition_via_api` setting:
```
loader_local = UnstructuredLoader(  file_path=file_path,  strategy="hi_res",)docs_local =[]for doc in loader_local.lazy_load():  docs_local.append(doc)
```

```
WARNING: This function will be deprecated in a future release and `unstructured` will simply use the DEFAULT_MODEL from `unstructured_inference.model.base` to set default model nameINFO: Reading PDF for file: /Users/chestercurme/repos/langchain/libs/community/tests/integration_tests/examples/layout-parser-paper.pdf ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Detecting page elements ...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: padding image by 20 for structure detectionINFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: padding image by 20 for structure detectionINFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...INFO: Processing entire page OCR with tesseract...
```

The list of documents can then be processed similarly to those obtained from the API.
## Use of multimodal models​
Many modern LLMs support inference over multimodal inputs (e.g., images). In some applications-- such as question-answering over PDFs with complex layouts, diagrams, or scans-- it may be advantageous to skip the PDF parsing, instead casting a PDF page to an image and passing it to a model directly. This allows a model to reason over the two dimensional content on the page, instead of a "one-dimensional" string representation.
In principle we can use any LangChain chat model that supports multimodal inputs. A list of these models is documented here. Below we use OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`.
First we define a short utility function to convert a PDF page to a base64-encoded image:
```
%pip install -qU PyMuPDF pillow langchain-openai
```

```
import base64import ioimport fitzfrom PIL import Imagedefpdf_page_to_base64(pdf_path:str, page_number:int):  pdf_document = fitz.open(pdf_path)  page = pdf_document.load_page(page_number -1)# input is one-indexed  pix = page.get_pixmap()  img = Image.frombytes("RGB",[pix.width, pix.height], pix.samples)buffer= io.BytesIO()  img.save(buffer,format="PNG")return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")
```

```
from IPython.display import Image as IPImagefrom IPython.display import displaybase64_image = pdf_page_to_base64(file_path,11)display(IPImage(data=base64.b64decode(base64_image)))
```

![](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/)
We can then query the model in the usual way. Below we ask it a question on related to the diagram on the page.
```
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

**API Reference:**ChatOpenAI
```
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessagequery ="What is the name of the first step in the pipeline?"message = HumanMessage(  content=[{"type":"text","text": query},{"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"},},],)response = llm.invoke([message])print(response.content)
```

**API Reference:**HumanMessage
```
INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"``````outputThe first step in the pipeline is "Annotate Layout Dataset."
```
