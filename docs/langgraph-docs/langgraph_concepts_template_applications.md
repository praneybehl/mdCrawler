# Template Applications¶
Templates are open source reference applications designed to help you get started quickly when building with LangGraph. They provide working examples of common agentic workflows that can be customized to your needs.
You can create an application from a template using the LangGraph CLI.
Requirements
  * Python >= 3.11
  * LangGraph CLI: Requires langchain-cli[inmem] >= 0.1.58


## Install the LangGraph CLI¶
```
pipinstall"langgraph-cli[inmem]"--upgrade

```

## Available Templates¶
Template | Description | Python | JS/TS  
---|---|---|---  
**New LangGraph Project** | A simple, minimal chatbot with memory. | Repo | Repo  
**ReAct Agent** | A simple agent that can be flexibly extended to many tools. | Repo | Repo  
**Memory Agent** | A ReAct-style agent with an additional tool to store memories for use across threads. | Repo | Repo  
**Retrieval Agent** | An agent that includes a retrieval-based question-answering system. | Repo | Repo  
**Data-Enrichment Agent** | An agent that performs web searches and organizes its findings into a structured format. | Repo | Repo  
## 🌱 Create a LangGraph App¶
To create a new app from a template, use the `langgraph new` command.
```
langgraphnew

```

## Next Steps¶
Review the `README.md` file in the root of your new LangGraph app for more information about the template and how to customize it.
After configuring the app properly and adding your API keys, you can start the app using the LangGraph CLI:
```
langgraphdev

```
