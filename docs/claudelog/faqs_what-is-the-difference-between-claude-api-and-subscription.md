I use both authentication methods depending on the project. Claude Code supports Anthropic API and Claude subscription plans, each with different cost structures, usage limits, and ideal use cases for development work.
### Authentication Methods​
**Claude Subscription (Pro/Max)**
  * **How it works** : Use your existing Claude subscription to authenticate Claude Code through browser login
  * **Cost** : Fixed monthly fee ($20 Pro, $100 Max, $200 Max) regardless of Claude Code usage
  * **Usage** : Shared limits with your web claude.ai usage


**Anthropic API**
  * **How it works** : Purchase API credits and authenticate using an API key from the Anthropic Console
  * **Cost** : Pay-per-token pricing based on actual usage
  * **Usage** : Dedicated limits separate from any web usage


### Cost Comparison​
Claude Pro Subscription at $20/month provides access to Sonnet 4 and Haiku 3.5 with moderate limits shared between Claude Code and web usage. This option works best for light Claude Code usage and becomes cost-effective if you already use web Claude regularly for other tasks.
Claude Max $100 Subscription at $100/month includes Sonnet 4 with 5x higher limits than Pro, plus limited access to Opus 4. This middle tier handles professional development with occasional complex analysis needs without the full cost of the $200 plan.
Claude Max $200 Subscription at $200/month includes all models with full Opus 4 access and 20x higher limits than Pro. I find this ideal for daily development work and it's usually cost-effective for full-time development where you need consistent, high-volume access and regular use of the most advanced model.
The Anthropic API uses pay-per-token pricing and scales with your actual consumption. This approach provides access to all models based on current API availability and works best for variable usage patterns and team environments where cost transparency matters.
### Usage Patterns​
Each authentication method suits different development workflows and organizational needs.
**Subscription Advantages**
Subscriptions provide predictable costs with a fixed monthly fee regardless of usage spikes, making budget planning straightforward. The simplicity factor is significant since you avoid usage tracking or credit management entirely. You also get seamless web integration using the same account for both Claude Code and web claude.ai, with browser authentication that requires minimal setup.
**API Advantages**
The API excels in usage transparency, providing detailed token tracking and cost breakdowns that help you understand exactly where your Claude Code usage goes. For teams, centralized billing and usage monitoring make organizational management much easier. You gain precise cost control by paying only for actual usage, which works better for variable workloads. Additionally, API limits are dedicated and don't compete with your web usage quota.
The API also includes additional functionality and is accessible everywhere. Subscription service does not work with every Anthropic integration, limiting your ability to use Claude across different tools and platforms that require API access.
### Model Access Comparison​
**Claude Pro Subscription** includes access to Claude 4 Sonnet with 5x usage limits compared to the free tier. However, it lacks access to the advanced Claude 4 Opus model. This plan works well for light development, small projects, and learning, though you may hit usage limits with extensive coding sessions.
**Claude Max $100 Subscription** provides access to Claude 4 Sonnet with 5x higher usage limits than Pro, plus limited access to the advanced Claude 4 Opus model. It handles professional development with moderate to large projects and occasional access to Opus for complex analysis when needed.
**Claude Max $200 Subscription** provides access to all Claude models including the advanced Claude 4 Opus, with 20x higher usage limits than Pro. This plan handles professional development with large projects and complex tasks, extended coding sessions without hitting limits, and full access to Opus for architectural decisions and complex analysis.
**Anthropic API** gives you access to all models based on current API availability with flexible usage allocation. You can optimize your model selection and usage distribution based on specific task requirements and cost considerations.
My Recommendation
I recommend starting with Claude Pro if you're new to Claude Code and already use web Claude. Upgrade to Max or switch to API based on your actual usage patterns after a few weeks of regular development work.
##### Authentication Choice Guidance
Subscription plans offer predictable costs while API provides usage transparency and team control. Start with Pro subscription if you're already using web Claude, then optimize based on patterns.
