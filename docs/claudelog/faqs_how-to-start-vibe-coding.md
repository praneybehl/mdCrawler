**Start vibe coding with Claude Code for the safest, most professional approach.** Claude Code provides Plan Mode safety, CLAUDE.md persistence, and terminal integration that scales from beginner experiments to production workflows.
### Getting Started Steps​
  * **Install Claude Code First** : `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` gives you direct model access without platform limitations
  * **Learn Plan Mode Safety** : Press `Shift+Tab` twice to research and plan before any code changes happen
  * **Create CLAUDE.md** : Document your project preferences for consistent results across sessions
  * **Start Simple** : Begin with basic projects like "create a single-page website" to build confidence
  * **Use Git Early** : Initialize repositories immediately for safe experimentation and rollback protection


### Essential Safety Practices​
  * **Plan Mode by Default** : Always activate Plan Mode for safety when starting out with vibe coding
  * **Outcome Testing** : Focus on whether results work correctly rather than examining implementation


### Workflow Integration​
**Working with Existing Tools** - Claude Code works alongside whatever tools you already use. You can continue using your favorite text editor or coding app while letting Claude Code handle the actual building. The key is establishing a simple rhythm: ask Claude Code to build features, then switch to your regular tools when you want to look at the results or make small tweaks. This way you get the speed of vibe coding without abandoning the tools you're comfortable with.
Unlike other vibe coding platforms that trap you in their ecosystems, Claude Code provides direct access to the raw model with professional development tool integration.
Professional Foundation
Claude Code's terminal integration and CLAUDE.md system create a scalable foundation that grows with your skills.
##### Foundation Building
Starting vibe coding requires building solid foundations through Plan Mode safety and systematic documentation practices. Claude Code's professional framework transforms experimental workflows into scalable development processes.
