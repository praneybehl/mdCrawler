I regularly switch between Claude models depending on the complexity of my tasks. Sonnet 4 for most daily work, Opus 4 when I need deep reasoning for complex refactoring or architectural decisions. I use Opus for debugging and solving algorithmic time-complexity issues.
### Available Models​
  * **Claude 4 Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`): Latest balanced performance and speed, excellent for most coding tasks, default choice for daily development
  * **Claude 4 Opus** (`claude-opus-4-20250514`): Maximum capability for complex tasks, best for complex architectural decisions, slower but more thorough responses, higher token usage
  * **Claude 3.5 Haiku** (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`): Fastest and most cost-effective, good for simple repetitive tasks, limited reasoning capabilities


### Switching Methods​
**1. Command Line Flag (Start Session)**
Switch models when starting Claude Code:
```
# Start with Sonnet 4 (default)claude --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514# Start with Opus 4claude --model claude-opus-4-20250514# Start with Haiku 3.5claude --model claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

**2. Session Command (Mid-Session)**
Switch models during an active Claude Code session:
```
# Switch to Opus for complex reasoning/model claude-opus-4-20250514# Switch back to Sonnet for regular tasks/model claude-sonnet-4-20250514# Switch to Haiku for simple tasks/model claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

### Model Selection Strategy​
I observe distinct patterns in when each model excels:
  * **Use Sonnet 4 for** : Daily coding tasks, bug fixes and debugging, writing tests and documentation, code reviews and explanations, most refactoring work
  * **Use Opus 4 for** : Complex architectural decisions, large-scale refactoring across multiple files, performance optimization analysis, debugging complex interaction patterns, design pattern implementation, UI/UX design and frontend work
  * **Use Haiku 3.5 for** : Repetitive tasks, simple file operations, basic documentation updates


##### Strategic Model Selection
Sonnet 4 handles daily coding while Opus 4 excels at complex architectural decisions and debugging. Model switching mid-session increases token costs due to conversation history processing.

My Strategy
I start with Sonnet 4 for most tasks. Only switch to Opus 4 when encountering problems that require deeper reasoning. Use Haiku 3.5 when running low on usage limits but need quick assistance.
Token Awareness
Switching models mid-session increases token consumption because the new model must process the entire conversation history. Consider starting fresh sessions when changing models for long conversations.
