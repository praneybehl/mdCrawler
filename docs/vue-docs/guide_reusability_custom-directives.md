# Custom Directives ​
## Introduction ​
In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.
We have introduced two forms of code reuse in Vue: components and composables. Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.
A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:
vue```
<script setup>
// enables v-highlight in templates
const vHighlight = {
 mounted: (el) => {
  el.classList.add('is-highlight')
 }
}
</script>
<template>
 <p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
</template>
```

js```
const highlight = {
 mounted: (el) => el.classList.add('is-highlight')
}
export default {
 directives: {
  // enables v-highlight in template
  highlight
 }
}
```

template```
<p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
```

This sentence is important!
In `<script setup>`, any camelCase variable that starts with the `v` prefix can be used as a custom directive. In the example above, `vHighlight` can be used in the template as `v-highlight`.
If you are not using `<script setup>`, custom directives can be registered using the `directives` option:
js```
export default {
 setup() {
  /*...*/
 },
 directives: {
  // enables v-highlight in template
  highlight: {
   /* ... */
  }
 }
}
```

Similar to components, custom directives must be registered so that they can be used in templates. In the example above, we are using local registration via the `directives` option.
It is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:
js```
const app = createApp({})
// make v-highlight usable in all components
app.directive('highlight', {
 /* ... */
})
```

## When to use custom directives ​
Custom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation.
A common example of this is a `v-focus` custom directive that brings an element into focus.
vue```
<script setup>
// enables v-focus in templates
const vFocus = {
 mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}
</script>
<template>
 <input v-focus />
</template>
```

js```
const focus = {
 mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}
export default {
 directives: {
  // enables v-focus in template
  focus
 }
}
```

template```
<input v-focus />
```

This directive is more useful than the `autofocus` attribute because it works not just on page load - it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue!
Declarative templating with built-in directives such as `v-bind` is recommended when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.
## Directive Hooks ​
A directive definition object can provide several hook functions (all optional):
js```
const myDirective = {
 // called before bound element's attributes
 // or event listeners are applied
 created(el, binding, vnode) {
  // see below for details on arguments
 },
 // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.
 beforeMount(el, binding, vnode) {},
 // called when the bound element's parent component
 // and all its children are mounted.
 mounted(el, binding, vnode) {},
 // called before the parent component is updated
 beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
 // called after the parent component and
 // all of its children have updated
 updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
 // called before the parent component is unmounted
 beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode) {},
 // called when the parent component is unmounted
 unmounted(el, binding, vnode) {}
}
```

### Hook Arguments ​
Directive hooks are passed these arguments:
  * `el`: the element the directive is bound to. This can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.
  * `binding`: an object containing the following properties.
    * `value`: The value passed to the directive. For example in `v-my-directive="1 + 1"`, the value would be `2`.
    * `oldValue`: The previous value, only available in `beforeUpdate` and `updated`. It is available whether or not the value has changed.
    * `arg`: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in `v-my-directive:foo`, the arg would be `"foo"`.
    * `modifiers`: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in `v-my-directive.foo.bar`, the modifiers object would be `{ foo: true, bar: true }`.
    * `instance`: The instance of the component where the directive is used.
    * `dir`: the directive definition object.
  * `vnode`: the underlying VNode representing the bound element.
  * `prevVnode`: the VNode representing the bound element from the previous render. Only available in the `beforeUpdate` and `updated` hooks.


As an example, consider the following directive usage:
template```
<div v-example:foo.bar="baz">
```

The `binding` argument would be an object in the shape of:
js```
{
 arg: 'foo',
 modifiers: { bar: true },
 value: /* value of `baz` */,
 oldValue: /* value of `baz` from previous update */
}
```

Similar to built-in directives, custom directive arguments can be dynamic. For example:
template```
<div v-example:[arg]="value"></div>
```

Here the directive argument will be reactively updated based on `arg` property in our component state.
Note
Apart from `el`, you should treat these arguments as read-only and never modify them. If you need to share information across hooks, it is recommended to do so through element's dataset.
## Function Shorthand ​
It's common for a custom directive to have the same behavior for `mounted` and `updated`, with no need for the other hooks. In such cases we can define the directive as a function:
template```
<div v-color="color"></div>
```

js```
app.directive('color', (el, binding) => {
 // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`
 el.style.color = binding.value
})
```

## Object Literals ​
If your directive needs multiple values, you can also pass in a JavaScript object literal. Remember, directives can take any valid JavaScript expression.
template```
<div v-demo="{ color: 'white', text: 'hello!' }"></div>
```

js```
app.directive('demo', (el, binding) => {
 console.log(binding.value.color) // => "white"
 console.log(binding.value.text) // => "hello!"
})
```

## Usage on Components ​
Not recommended
Using custom directives on components is not recommended. Unexpected behaviour may occur when a component has multiple root nodes.
When used on components, custom directives will always apply to a component's root node, similar to Fallthrough Attributes.
template```
<MyComponent v-demo="test" />
```

template```
<!-- template of MyComponent -->
<div> <!-- v-demo directive will be applied here -->
 <span>My component content</span>
</div>
```

Note that components can potentially have more than one root node. When applied to a multi-root component, a directive will be ignored and a warning will be thrown. Unlike attributes, directives can't be passed to a different element with `v-bind="$attrs"`.
