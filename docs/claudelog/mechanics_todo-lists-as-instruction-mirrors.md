The Todo list tool is my second favourite Claude Code tool, second only to the Task/Agent tool. The Todo list tool serves a purpose beyond just tracking progress, it reveals how Claude interprets your instructions.
I often benchmark my instructions against Claude's todos, particularly for step by step processes I am aspiring for a mirror like reflection. When his todos mirror my intentions, I know my instructions are grokked. When his todos diverge, it flags an area for potential improvement in my communication.
**Todo List Divergence**
  * **Out of Order** : Instructions specify step A then B, but Claude's todos list B then A
  * **Missing Todo Item** : Instructions mention running tests, but Claude's todo list omits this step entirely
  * **Extra Todo Item** : Claude adds "backup existing files" when instructions never mentioned this
  * **Wrong Granularity** : Instructions say "update documentation" but Claude creates separate todos for each individual file
  * **Misinterpreted Step** : Instructions say "review changes" but Claude lists "commit changes" instead


**Real-Time Steering**
Claude's todo list communicates the effects of real-time steering of Claude's goals. You can steer future todo items as Claude reviews your prompts mid-task and uses them to update his planning.
Consider a basic example of changing an element's colour. Properly utilising the todo list allows for clearer steering of future todos as you can see exactly what he plans to do.
**Before Steering:**
  * Fix the navigation menu alignment
  * Update the footer text
  * Add new contact form validation
  * Change the button background color to `blue`
  * Update documentation


**Mid-task Steering:**
```
Actually make it green instead
```

**After Steering:**
  * Fix the navigation menu alignment
  * Update the footer text
  * Add new contact form validation
  * Change the button background color to `green`
  * Update documentation


##### Experiment
Try encouraging Claude to be granular with his todos. Instead of "style the navbar," get Claude to reveal specific adjustments: "change height from 60px to 80px," "reduce padding-top from 16px to 12px," "adjust background from #ffffff to rgba(255,255,255,0.95)." This transparency exposes Claude's design decisions before he makes them, letting you approve or redirect his aesthetic choices.
