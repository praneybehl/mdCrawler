Vibe coding's core philosophy of focusing on outcomes instead of code creates a tension with security awareness. As one expert puts it: "This is the single biggest challenge with vibe coding. The most obvious problem is that they're going to build stuff insecurely." The good news is these issues are completely preventable when you balance speed with proper safety practices.
### Common Security Problems​
**Features That Look Like They Work But Don't** - Sometimes you build a login system that always says "Welcome!" even with wrong passwords. Or a contact form that shows "Message sent!" but doesn't actually send emails. These fake results fool you into thinking everything works properly. Real vibe coders have experienced bypassed subscriptions, maxed-out API keys, and database corruption from features that appeared to work correctly.
**Not Checking User Input Properly** - If you don't test what happens when users type weird things into forms, attackers can break your website or steal information. This happens when you only test with normal, polite input. Major platforms have discovered that many AI-created apps suffer from the same input validation problems.
**Using Test Data Instead of Real Data** - Your website might work perfectly when you test it with fake information, but break completely when real people use it with real email addresses and actual data.
**Showing Error Messages That Help Attackers** - Error messages that say things like "Database connection failed" or show file paths give attackers information they can use to break your system.
**Outdated or Insecure Dependencies** - AI often adds code libraries and packages without checking if they're safe or up to date. These can have known security holes that attackers already know how to exploit.
### Warning Signs to Watch For​
**Things Work Too Perfectly** - If everything works on the first try and nothing ever goes wrong, that's suspicious. Real systems have rough edges and occasional problems.
**Results That Never Change** - If your search always returns the same results or your forms never reject bad input, something is probably hardcoded instead of working properly.
**Everything Happens Too Fast** - If responses appear instantly or complex features get built in minutes, check if the results are actually real. As you build your experience you will have a feel for how complex requests are and how much code should be changed.
### How to Stay Safe with Claude Code​
**Use Plan Mode for Important Features** - When building login systems, payment processing, or anything that handles personal information, use Plan Mode to see what Claude Code will do before it happens. This addresses the core tension between vibe coding speed and security awareness.
**Test with Real Information** - Use your actual email address, real names, and proper phone numbers when testing. Don't just type "test@test.com" and assume it works.
**Try to Break Things on Purpose** - Submit forms without filling them out. Try uploading huge files. Type special characters and symbols. Ask Claude Code to suggest ways normal users might accidentally break your site so you can test those scenarios.
**Document Security Requirements** - Tell Claude Code to write in your `CLAUDE.md` file what security features you need, like "Login must require real passwords" and "Contact forms must actually send emails." Include constraints about what security measures must never be skipped.
**Use Battle-Tested Patterns and Templates** - Instead of building everything from scratch where AI might create vulnerabilities, use existing frameworks and proven GitHub templates with established security practices. Ask Claude Code to build on top of well-maintained, widely-used foundations rather than inventing new approaches.
**Check Dependencies and Libraries** - Ask Claude Code to explain what code libraries it's adding and verify they're current and secure. Request that it avoid outdated packages and explain why it's choosing specific dependencies.
**Check That Everything Actually Works** - If you build a contact form, fill it out AND check that you receive the email. If you build user accounts, try logging in with wrong passwords to make sure they get rejected.
**Keep Backups with Git** - When something works properly, ask Claude Code to commit it to git immediately. This way you can always go back to a working version if changes break security features.
**Different Standards for Different Projects** - Throwaway weekend projects can use relaxed security, but anything real people will use needs thorough testing and proper security measures.
Be Cautious About Security
When building anything that real people will use, especially if it handles personal information or money, take extra time to test everything thoroughly. Ask Claude Code to explain how security features work and document them in your `CLAUDE.md`. Use strategic prompting and constraint definition techniques to maintain vibe coding benefits while ensuring security.
##### Security Excitement
Security awareness amplifies vibe coding excitement by ensuring your creative flow produces robust, production-ready applications. Proper safety practices unlock the full potential of outcome-focused development without compromising reliability.
