For support, please open a ticket in the support forum at `https://redqsupport.ticksy.com/`
> There are some basic requirements for our application so that the support team can assist you quickly, such as:
  1. Asking queries regarding features that are already implemented in the application.
  2. Following the recommended configuration, environments, and server specifications that need to be met before you proceed with installation or deployment on your server to receive support.
  3. Support queries need to adhere to the Envato item support policy (https://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy).
  4. Maintain only one support ticket at a time, as creating multiple tickets can cause unexpected delays.
  5. Tickets should provide as much detail as possible related to the issue, such as screenshots, video explanations, access information, steps to reproduce the issue, details about any changes or customizations made, etc.


> During working days, our ticket response may take 24 to 48 hours, depending on the volume of tickets pending prior to yours. We follow the Envato Item support policy (https://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy) to provide standard support for our items.
