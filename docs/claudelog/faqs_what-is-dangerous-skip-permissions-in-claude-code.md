Dangerous Skip Permissions is Claude Code's nuclear option that uses the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to bypass all permission checks and eliminate safety guardrails entirely. In this YOLO mode, Claude Code executes all operations without any permission prompts, including file modifications, command execution, and system operations.
### How to Use It​
Start Claude Code with the dangerous flag to enter YOLO mode. The flag name deliberately includes "dangerously" to signal the security implications of removing all restrictions.
```
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### Why Use It​
The appeal becomes obvious during extended autonomous work sessions when constant permission interruptions break workflow. However, this represents the most permissive end of the safety spectrum, going beyond auto-accept permissions to remove all safety mechanisms entirely.
**Risks:**
  * **No Safety Barriers** - Claude can execute any operation including destructive commands
  * **Compound Risk** - Single misinterpreted instruction could cascade into significant damage
  * **File Deletions** - Unrestricted access to system modifications and file operations
  * **Security Vulnerability** - Universal access creates maximum exposure to potential issues
  * **No Oversight** - Complete removal of human verification checkpoints


This approach has led to horror stories where development environments were destroyed by Claude running wild with unrestricted permissions.
### Benefits​
AllowedTools Configuration Provides Superior Control:
  * **Granular Permissions** - Explicit specification of which tools can run without prompts
  * **Security Transparency** - Clear understanding of which operations are automated
  * **Persistent Configuration** - Consistent behavior across sessions and projects
  * **Audit Trail** - Visible and auditable permission structure in `~/.claude.json`
  * **Principle of Least Privilege** - Grant only necessary permissions rather than universal access


I observe that explicit allowedTools configuration creates better security awareness compared to blanket permission bypassing, making it easier to audit and adjust permissions as needed.
Docker Alternative
Community members have addressed dangerous permissions through Docker isolation containers, but this adds complexity that explicit tool configuration avoids entirely.
Safer Alternative
Use allowedTools configuration for granular control instead of the nuclear approach of disabling all safety checks.
##### Nuclear Safety Option
Dangerous skip permissions removes all safety guardrails for complete unrestricted execution. AllowedTools configuration provides superior granular control compared to blanket permission bypassing.
