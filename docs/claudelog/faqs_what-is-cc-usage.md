CC Usage is a command-line tool that tracks and analyzes your Claude Code API usage, costs, and token consumption patterns. It shows where your tokens go and helps optimize expensive operations.
### Installation​
```
npx ccusage@latest
```

For daily reports, install globally with `npm install -g ccusage && ccusage daily`.
### What It Does​
CC Usage analyzes your Claude Code logs to show daily/monthly usage reports, cost breakdowns with USD estimates, and token consumption patterns. You can filter by date ranges and export data as JSON for automation.
### How to Use It​
```
ccusage daily  # Daily usage reportccusage monthly # Monthly summary
```

### Why Use It​
I observe that many Claude Code users hit subscription limits without understanding their consumption. CC Usage provides transparency to optimize workflows and see the real value of your Claude subscription.
Developers frequently express frustration about unexpected limits. CC Usage solves this by showing exactly where tokens are being consumed.
