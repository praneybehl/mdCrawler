Building Your ApplicationRoutingCustom Errors
# Custom Errors
## 404 Page
A 404 page may be accessed very often. Server-rendering an error page for every visit increases the load of the Next.js server. This can result in increased costs and slow experiences.
To avoid the above pitfalls, Next.js provides a static 404 page by default without having to add any additional files.
### Customizing The 404 Page
To create a custom 404 page you can create a `pages/404.js` file. This file is statically generated at build time.
pages/404.js
```
exportdefaultfunctionCustom404() {
return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
}
```

> **Good to know** : You can use `getStaticProps` inside this page if you need to fetch data at build time.
## 500 Page
Server-rendering an error page for every visit adds complexity to responding to errors. To help users get responses to errors as fast as possible, Next.js provides a static 500 page by default without having to add any additional files.
### Customizing The 500 Page
To customize the 500 page you can create a `pages/500.js` file. This file is statically generated at build time.
pages/500.js
```
exportdefaultfunctionCustom500() {
return <h1>500 - Server-side error occurred</h1>
}
```

> **Good to know** : You can use `getStaticProps` inside this page if you need to fetch data at build time.
### More Advanced Error Page Customizing
500 errors are handled both client-side and server-side by the `Error` component. If you wish to override it, define the file `pages/_error.js` and add the following code:
```
functionError({ statusCode }) {
return (
  <p>
   {statusCode
?`An error ${statusCode} occurred on server`
:'An error occurred on client'}
  </p>
 )
}
Error.getInitialProps= ({ res, err }) => {
conststatusCode= res ?res.statusCode : err ?err.statusCode :404
return { statusCode }
}
exportdefault Error
```

> `pages/_error.js` is only used in production. In development you’ll get an error with the call stack to know where the error originated from.
### Reusing the built-in error page
If you want to render the built-in error page you can by importing the `Error` component:
```
import Error from'next/error'
exportasyncfunctiongetServerSideProps() {
constres=awaitfetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')
consterrorCode=res.ok ?false:res.status
constjson=awaitres.json()
return {
  props: { errorCode, stars:json.stargazers_count },
 }
}
exportdefaultfunctionPage({ errorCode, stars }) {
if (errorCode) {
return <ErrorstatusCode={errorCode} />
 }
return <div>Next stars: {stars}</div>
}
```

The `Error` component also takes `title` as a property if you want to pass in a text message along with a `statusCode`.
If you have a custom `Error` component be sure to import that one instead. `next/error` exports the default component used by Next.js.
### Caveats
  * `Error` does not currently support Next.js Data Fetching methods like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.
  * `_error`, like `_app`, is a reserved pathname. `_error` is used to define the customized layouts and behaviors of the error pages. `/_error` will render 404 when accessed directly via routing or rendering in a custom server.
