When Claude Code is in interactive mode you can have Claude modify its own `CLAUDE.md` temporarily to run tasks with a specific context. After the task is completed you can ask Claude to revert the `CLAUDE.md` back to its previous state. There are several ways of backing up the `CLAUDE.md`:
  * **Git versioning** : Use git stash or commit before changes for easy rollback
  * **File duplication** : Have Claude copy to a backup filename like `CLAUDE.md.backup`


To change the information persisted through the `CLAUDE.md` interface you can use 'quick Memory' with #.
This mechanic is useful if you have a `CLAUDE.md` library which specifies the processes for performing different tasks. Unfortunately, Claude is currently unable to read changes to his `CLAUDE.md` into 'memory' unless it utilises explicit commands such as:
  * **Quick Memory** : Using # commands to temporarily change persisted information
  * **Memory refresh commands** : Explicitly asking Claude to re-read the modified `CLAUDE.md`
  * **Session restart** : Starting a new Claude Code session to pick up changes
  * **Explicit file reads** : Using read commands to load the updated content


This led to me exploring getting Claude to spawn another instance of itself in a directory which has a different `CLAUDE.md`. The benefits being:
  * **Cleaner context separation** : Each spawned instance operates with its own specific `CLAUDE.md` context
  * **No memory reload issues** : New instances automatically load their directory's `CLAUDE.md`
  * **Parallel processing** : Multiple contexts can run simultaneously without interference
  * **Reduced context pollution** : Previous session context doesn't bleed into the new specialized task


**Note:** Claude instances will automatically crawl up the directory structure and read any `CLAUDE.md` files they encounter. So to have a strict separation of context ensure the project directory `CLAUDE.md` is lightweight and non-specific.
