**Q: How do I configure terminal setup for Claude Code?** A: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter for linebreaks in VS Code and iTerm2. Use `\` + Enter as a quick escape for linebreaks when keyboard shortcuts aren't configured. Terminal setup guide
**Q: How do I set up terminal bell notifications on Windows WSL?** A: For Windows WSL users, standard terminal bell often doesn't work. Use PowerShell commands for audio notifications instead. Setup notifications
**Q: What is Sub-Agent Delegation in Claude Code?** A: Sub-agent delegation uses the Task tool to spawn parallel agents for asynchronous processing. Multiple sub-agents work simultaneously on different aspects of complex tasks, avoiding sequential waiting and improving efficiency. Sub-agent guide
**Q: How do sub-agents work in Claude Code and when should I use them?** A: Sub-agents are parallel task executors that run independently with their own context window. They're useful for tasks requiring multiple file operations or research phases. For example, if Claude needs to write several different files on different topics, each sub-agent can research and write independently. Sub-agents perform tasks significantly faster than the interactive Claude instance.
**Q: Do sub-agents consume the main agent's context window?** A: Sub-agents have their own separate context windows and are provided with the task and light context. Only the results they return consume space in the main agent's context window, not their internal processing. This makes them efficient for complex multi-step tasks.
**Q: How do I control how many sub-agents Claude Code uses?** A: You can explicitly request the number of sub-agents: "Use 3 sub-agents to handle this task" or "Create a sub-agent for each file that needs updating." Claude also automatically uses sub-agents for non-Write/Edit tasks when appropriate.
**Q: Can you use Claude Code with multiple codebases simultaneously?** A: Yes, open a separate terminal window for each codebase. Each Claude Code instance runs independently with its own context and session.
