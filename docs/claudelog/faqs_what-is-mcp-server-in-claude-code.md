MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. They act as bridges between Claude and specialized functionality like web search through Brave, up-to-date documentation via Context7, or other API integrations that aren't built into Claude Code by default.
### How to Use It​
**JSON Configuration** - Configure MCP servers in your `~/.claude.json` file under the `mcpServers` section. Each server runs as a separate process that Claude Code communicates with through the Model Context Protocol.
**Interactive Management** - Use the `/mcp` command to view currently configured MCP servers and their status without editing configuration files manually.
### Why Use It​
MCP servers let me access functionality beyond Claude Code's core tools. I use them when I need specialized capabilities like web search with Brave, up-to-date documentation through Context7, or accessing external APIs that enhance my workflow analysis.
**Benefits:**
  * **Extended Capabilities** - Access tools and services not available in core Claude Code
  * **Modular Design** - Add only the functionality you need without bloating Claude Code
  * **Community Ecosystem** - Leverage community-built integrations and specialized tools
  * **Flexible Configuration** - Enable different servers for different projects or workflows
  * **Real-time Data** - Connect to live APIs and services for current information


I configure MCP servers when I need capabilities like web search through Brave, current documentation via Context7, or specialized API access that complement Claude Code's file management and coding tools.
