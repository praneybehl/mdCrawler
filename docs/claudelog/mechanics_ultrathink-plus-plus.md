In case you have not heard you can adjust the degree to which Claude utilises test-time compute. Adding `ultrathink` within your prompt indicates to Claude that he should give it his all thinking wise.
### Ultrathink & Plan Mode​
I personally get outstanding results using `ultrathink` + `Plan Mode` with `Claude 4 Sonnet`. This combination is especially useful when you don't want to reach for `Claude 4 Opus`. I have found it can often bridge the intelligence gap for complex tasks, and when that's not sufficient, I opt to `rev` the model by performing multiple critiqued rounds of `ultrathink` + `Plan Mode`.
### Revving the Engine​
Revving the engine means instructing Claude to create a plan in `Plan Mode`, then systematically critiquing that plan for missing edge cases, redundant aspects, and ordering inefficiencies. This iterative process pushes the model through multiple thinking cycles to reach higher performance.
### The Ultimate Stack​
If you are struggling to get the performance from `ultrathink` + `Sonnet` + `Plan Mode` + `revving` you can throw `sub-agents` into the mix. Requesting Claude to use `split role sub-agents` to analyse task or plan where each sub-agent has a different role which influences its suggestions towards the plan.
This tactic is token efficient thanks to utilising Sonnet and is scalable regarding to how many sub-agents/roles are utilised and the degree of thinking applied.
### Why Ultrathink Before Opus​
`ultrathink` is a must utilise mechanic which ideally should be used in combinations with the other available mechanics prior to reaching for a superior model like Opus.
Why? Because otherwise you are learning to be unnecessarily reliant on a model which is 5X more expensive without delivering 5X more value.
### The Complete Stack​
  * **Base** : `ultrathink` for enhanced thinking
  * **Planning** : `Plan Mode` for structured approach
  * **Iteration** : `revving` for multiple critique rounds
  * **Perspectives** : `split role sub-agents` for diverse analysis


##### Compute Optimization
The above mechanics reveal the hidden potential in systematic mechanic stacking. By combining `ultrathink`, `Plan Mode`, `revving`, and `split role sub-agents`, you unlock intelligence amplification that transforms how complex problems get solved.
