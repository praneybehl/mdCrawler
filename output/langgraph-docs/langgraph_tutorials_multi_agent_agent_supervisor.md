# Multi-agent supervisor¶
The previous example routed messages automatically based on the output of the initial researcher agent.
We can also choose to use an LLM to orchestrate the different agents.
Below, we will create an agent group, with an agent supervisor to help delegate tasks.
![diagram](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor/)
To simplify the code in each agent node, we will use LangGraph's prebuilt create_react_agent. This and other "advanced agent" notebooks are designed to show how you can implement certain design patterns in LangGraph. If the pattern suits your needs, we recommend combining it with some of the other fundamental patterns described elsewhere in the docs for best performance.
## Setup¶
First, let's install required packages and set our API keys
```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_community langchain_anthropic langchain_experimental

```

```
importgetpass
importos


def_set_if_undefined(var: str):
  if not os.environ.get(var):
    os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"Please provide your {var}")


_set_if_undefined("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_if_undefined("TAVILY_API_KEY")

```

Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
## Create tools¶
For this example, you will make an agent to do web research with a search engine, and one agent to create plots. Define the tools they'll use below:
```
fromtypingimport Annotated

fromlangchain_community.tools.tavily_searchimport TavilySearchResults
fromlangchain_core.toolsimport tool
fromlangchain_experimental.utilitiesimport PythonREPL

tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)

# This executes code locally, which can be unsafe
repl = PythonREPL()


@tool
defpython_repl_tool(
  code: Annotated[str, "The python code to execute to generate your chart."],
):
"""Use this to execute python code and do math. If you want to see the output of a value,
  you should print it out with `print(...)`. This is visible to the user."""
  try:
    result = repl.run(code)
  except BaseException as e:
    return f"Failed to execute. Error: {repr(e)}"
  result_str = f"Successfully executed:\n\`\`\`python\n{code}\n\`\`\`\nStdout: {result}"
  return result_str

```

API Reference: TavilySearchResults | tool | PythonREPL
### Create Agent Supervisor¶
It will use LLM with structured output to choose the next worker node OR finish processing.
```
fromtypingimport Literal
fromtyping_extensionsimport TypedDict

fromlangchain_anthropicimport ChatAnthropic
fromlanggraph.graphimport MessagesState, END
fromlanggraph.typesimport Command


members = ["researcher", "coder"]
# Our team supervisor is an LLM node. It just picks the next agent to process
# and decides when the work is completed
options = members + ["FINISH"]

system_prompt = (
  "You are a supervisor tasked with managing a conversation between the"
  f" following workers: {members}. Given the following user request,"
  " respond with the worker to act next. Each worker will perform a"
  " task and respond with their results and status. When finished,"
  " respond with FINISH."
)


classRouter(TypedDict):
"""Worker to route to next. If no workers needed, route to FINISH."""

  next: Literal[*options]


llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")


classState(MessagesState):
  next: str


defsupervisor_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[*members, "__end__"]]:
  messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
  ] + state["messages"]
  response = llm.with_structured_output(Router).invoke(messages)
  goto = response["next"]
  if goto == "FINISH":
    goto = END

  return Command(goto=goto, update={"next": goto})

```

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | END | Command
## Construct Graph¶
We're ready to start building the graph. Below, define the state and worker nodes using the function we just defined.
```
fromlangchain_core.messagesimport HumanMessage
fromlanggraph.graphimport StateGraph, START, END
fromlanggraph.prebuiltimport create_react_agent


research_agent = create_react_agent(
  llm, tools=[tavily_tool], prompt="You are a researcher. DO NOT do any math."
)


defresearch_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
  result = research_agent.invoke(state)
  return Command(
    update={
      "messages": [
        HumanMessage(content=result["messages"][-1].content, name="researcher")
      ]
    },
    goto="supervisor",
  )


# NOTE: THIS PERFORMS ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION, WHICH CAN BE UNSAFE WHEN NOT SANDBOXED
code_agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=[python_repl_tool])


defcode_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
  result = code_agent.invoke(state)
  return Command(
    update={
      "messages": [
        HumanMessage(content=result["messages"][-1].content, name="coder")
      ]
    },
    goto="supervisor",
  )


builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "supervisor")
builder.add_node("supervisor", supervisor_node)
builder.add_node("researcher", research_node)
builder.add_node("coder", code_node)
graph = builder.compile()

```

API Reference: HumanMessage | StateGraph | START | END | create_react_agent
```
fromIPython.displayimport display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

```

## Invoke the team¶
With the graph created, we can now invoke it and see how it performs!
```
for s in graph.stream(
  {"messages": [("user", "What's the square root of 42?")]}, subgraphs=True
):
  print(s)
  print("----")

```

```
