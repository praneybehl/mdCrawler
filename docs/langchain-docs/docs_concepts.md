This guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind the LangChain framework and AI applications more broadly.
We recommend that you go through at least one of the Tutorials before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.
The conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples — those are found in the How-to guides and Tutorials. For detailed reference material, please see the API reference.
## High level​
  * **Why LangChain?** : Overview of the value that LangChain provides.
  * **Architecture** : How packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.


## Concepts​
  * **Chat models** : LLMs exposed via a chat API that process sequences of messages as input and output a message.
  * **Messages** : The unit of communication in chat models, used to represent model input and output.
  * **Chat history** : A conversation represented as a sequence of messages, alternating between user messages and model responses.
  * **Tools** : A function with an associated schema defining the function's name, description, and the arguments it accepts.
  * **Tool calling** : A type of chat model API that accepts tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as part of the output message.
  * **Structured output** : A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.
  * **Memory** : Information about a conversation that is persisted so that it can be used in future conversations.
  * **Multimodality** : The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.
  * **Runnable interface** : The base abstraction that many LangChain components and the LangChain Expression Language are built on.
  * **Streaming** : LangChain streaming APIs for surfacing results as they are generated.
  * **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** : A syntax for orchestrating LangChain components. Most useful for simpler applications.
  * **Document loaders** : Load a source as a list of documents.
  * **Retrieval** : Information retrieval systems can retrieve structured or unstructured data from a datasource in response to a query.
  * **Text splitters** : Split long text into smaller chunks that can be individually indexed to enable granular retrieval.
  * **Embedding models** : Models that represent data such as text or images in a vector space.
  * **Vector stores** : Storage of and efficient search over vectors and associated metadata.
  * **Retriever** : A component that returns relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.
  * **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** : A technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.
  * **Agents** : Use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. Agents can interact with external resources via tool.
  * **Prompt templates** : Component for factoring out the static parts of a model "prompt" (usually a sequence of messages). Useful for serializing, versioning, and reusing these static parts.
  * **Output parsers** : Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it into a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Output parsers were primarily useful prior to the general availability of tool calling and structured outputs.
  * **Few-shot prompting** : A technique for improving model performance by providing a few examples of the task to perform in the prompt.
  * **Example selectors** : Used to select the most relevant examples from a dataset based on a given input. Example selectors are used in few-shot prompting to select examples for a prompt.
  * **Async programming** : The basics that one should know to use LangChain in an asynchronous context.
  * **Callbacks** : Callbacks enable the execution of custom auxiliary code in built-in components. Callbacks are used to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain, trace the intermediate steps of an application, and more.
  * **Tracing** : The process of recording the steps that an application takes to go from input to output. Tracing is essential for debugging and diagnosing issues in complex applications.
  * **Evaluation** : The process of assessing the performance and effectiveness of AI applications. This involves testing the model's responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose. This process is vital for building reliable applications.
  * **Testing** : The process of verifying that a component of an integration or application works as expected. Testing is essential for ensuring that the application behaves correctly and that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs.
