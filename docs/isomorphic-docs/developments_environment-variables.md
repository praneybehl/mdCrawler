## Environment Variablesâ€‹
Every workspace contains their own environment variables. You can check them in the `.env.local.example` file.
> The deployment process requires some environment variables to be set. You have to set these variables in each workspace's `.env` file.
> And also attach these required environment variables in the `turbo.json` files build command in root directory for deployments. Otherwise the deployment process will fail.
