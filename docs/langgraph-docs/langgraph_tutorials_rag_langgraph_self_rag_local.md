# Self-RAG using local LLMs¶
Self-RAG is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-reflection / self-grading on retrieved documents and generations. 
In the paper, a few decisions are made:
  1. Should I retrieve from retriever, `R` -
  2. Input: `x (question)` OR `x (question)`, `y (generation)`
  3. Decides when to retrieve `D` chunks with `R`
  4. Output: `yes, no, continue`
  5. Are the retrieved passages `D` relevant to the question `x` -
  6.      * Input: (`x (question)`, `d (chunk)`) for `d` in `D`
  7. `d` provides useful information to solve `x`
  8. Output: `relevant, irrelevant`
  9. Are the LLM generation from each chunk in `D` is relevant to the chunk (hallucinations, etc) -
  10. Input: `x (question)`, `d (chunk)`, `y (generation)` for `d` in `D`
  11. All of the verification-worthy statements in `y (generation)` are supported by `d`
  12. Output: `{fully supported, partially supported, no support`
  13. The LLM generation from each chunk in `D` is a useful response to `x (question)` -
  14. Input: `x (question)`, `y (generation)` for `d` in `D`
  15. `y (generation)` is a useful response to `x (question)`.
  16. Output: `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`


We will implement some of these ideas from scratch using LangGraph.

## Setup¶
First let's install our required packages and set our API keys
```
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain-nomic langchain_community tiktoken langchainhub chromadb langchain langgraph nomic[local]

```

```

### LLMs¶
#### Local Embeddings¶
You can use `GPT4AllEmbeddings()` from Nomic, which can access use Nomic's recently released v1 and v1.5 embeddings.
Follow the documentation here.
#### Local LLM¶
(1) Download Ollama app.
(2) Download a `Mistral` model from various Mistral versions here and Mixtral versions here available. 
```
ollama pull mistral

```

```
# Ollama model name
local_llm = "mistral"

 In an LLM-powered autonomous agent system, the Large Language Model (LLM) functions as the agent's brain. The agent has key components including memory, planning, and reflection mechanisms. The memory component is a long-term memory module that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language. It includes a memory stream, which is an external database for storing past experiences. The reflection mechanism synthesizes memories into higher-level inferences over time and guides the agent's future behavior.
