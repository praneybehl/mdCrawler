A 503 error indicates server issues on Anthropic's end, not problems with your Claude Code installation. This means Anthropic's servers are temporarily busy or under maintenance.
### What 503 Error Means​
  * **Not your fault** : Server-side issue, not your setup
  * **Temporary** : Usually resolves in 2-5 minutes automatically
  * **Common** : Happens during high usage periods or brief maintenance


### Quick Resolution Steps​
  * **Wait patiently** : Most resolve automatically in 2-5 minutes
  * **Check official status** : Visit https://status.anthropic.com/ for real-time updates
  * **Check community reports** : Visit r/ClaudeAI subreddit to see if others report the same issue
  * **Verify it's widespread** : Look for multiple user reports and status page incidents


### Your Setup is Fine​
503 errors don't damage Claude Code or require reinstallation. Your API key, settings, and local installation remain intact.
### What NOT to Do​
  * **Don't reinstall** : Claude Code installation is fine
  * **Don't change** : Your API keys or configuration
  * **Don't restart** : Your computer or clear cache
  * **Don't troubleshoot** : Local settings when it's a server issue


### When to Take Action​
**Only escalate if truly necessary** - 503 errors typically resolve themselves. Take action only if:
  * **Error persists** : For more than 10 minutes
  * **Status page** : Shows no known issues
  * **No community reports** : Of similar problems
  * **Try basic steps** : Restart Claude Code or check network connection


Resolution Time
503 errors are almost always temporary server hiccups. The best approach is patience - these errors typically resolve faster than the time it takes to troubleshoot your local setup.
##### Server Overload Signal
503 errors are Anthropic's servers saying "overwhelmed, not broken" - patience beats reinstalling. Your Claude Code setup remains intact while servers catch their breath.
