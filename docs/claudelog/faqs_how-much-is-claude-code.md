Claude Code pricing depends on your usage pattern and model preferences. You can choose between fixed monthly subscriptions or pay-per-use API access based on your development needs.
### Subscription Options​
  * **Claude Pro** : $20/month - Basic Claude Code access with Sonnet and Haiku models, suitable for light development
  * **Claude Max 5x** : $100/month - Professional tier with 5x Pro limits and limited Claude 4 Opus access
  * **Claude Max 20x** : $200/month - Full professional tier with 20x Pro limits and unlimited Claude 4 Opus access


### Which Option to Choose​
I use Claude Max 5x for professional development work where occasional Opus access is sufficient for complex architectural decisions. Claude Max 20x is better for intensive development requiring frequent Opus access throughout the workday.
**Cost Considerations:**
  * **Light Usage** : Claude Pro for casual development and learning
  * **Moderate Professional** : Claude Max 5x for regular development with some complex tasks
  * **Heavy Professional** : Claude Max 20x for daily intensive development requiring Opus
