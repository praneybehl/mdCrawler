# next CLI
The Next.js CLI allows you to develop, build, start your application, and more.
Basic usage:
Terminal
```
npx next [command] [options]
```

## Reference
The following options are available:
Options| Description  
---|---  
`-h` or `--help`| Shows all available options  
`-v` or `--version`| Outputs the Next.js version number  
### Commands
The following commands are available:
Command| Description  
---|---  
`dev`| Starts Next.js in development mode with Hot Module Reloading, error reporting, and more.  
`build`| Creates an optimized production build of your application. Displaying information about each route.  
`start`| Starts Next.js in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build` first.  
`info`| Prints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs.  
`lint`| Runs ESLint for all files in the `/src`, `/app`, `/pages`, `/components`, and `/lib` directories. It also provides a guided setup to install any required dependencies if ESLint it is not already configured in your application.  
`telemetry`| Allows you to enable or disable Next.js' completely anonymous telemetry collection.  
> **Good to know** : Running `next` without a command is an alias for `next dev`.
### `next dev` options
`next dev` starts the application in development mode with Hot Module Reloading (HMR), error reporting, and more. The following options are available when running `next dev`:
Option| Description  
---|---  
`-h, --help`| Show all available options.  
`[directory]`| A directory in which to build the application. If not provided, current directory is used.  
`--turbopack`| Starts development mode using Turbopack.  
`-p` or `--port <port>`| Specify a port number on which to start the application. Default: 3000, env: PORT  
`-H`or `--hostname <hostname>`| Specify a hostname on which to start the application. Useful for making the application available for other devices on the network. Default: 0.0.0.0  
`--experimental-https`| Starts the server with HTTPS and generates a self-signed certificate.  
`--experimental-https-key <path>`| Path to a HTTPS key file.  
`--experimental-https-cert <path>`| Path to a HTTPS certificate file.  
`--experimental-https-ca <path>`| Path to a HTTPS certificate authority file.  
`--experimental-upload-trace <traceUrl>`| Reports a subset of the debugging trace to a remote HTTP URL.  
### `next build` options
`next build` creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route. For example:
Terminal
```
Route (app)               SizeFirstLoadJS
┌ ○/_not-found0B0kB
└ ƒ/products/[id]0B0kB
○ (Static)  prerenderedasstaticcontent
ƒ (Dynamic) server-renderedondemand
```

  * **Size** : The size of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.
  * **First Load JS** : The size of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.


Both of these values are **compressed with gzip**. The first load is indicated by green, yellow, or red. Aim for green for performant applications.
The following options are available for the `next build` command:
Option| Description  
---|---  
`-h, --help`| Show all available options.  
`[directory]`| A directory on which to build the application. If not provided, the current directory will be used.  
`-d` or `--debug`| Enables a more verbose build output. With this flag enabled additional build output like rewrites, redirects, and headers will be shown.  
`--profile`| Enables production profiling for React.  
`--no-lint`| Disables linting.  
`--no-mangling`| Disables mangling. This may affect performance and should only be used for debugging purposes.  
`--experimental-app-only`| Builds only App Router routes.  
`--experimental-build-mode [mode]`| Uses an experimental build mode. (choices: "compile", "generate", default: "default")  
### `next start` options
`next start` starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build` first.
The following options are available for the `next start` command:
Option| Description  
---|---  
`-h` or `--help`| Show all available options.  
`[directory]`| A directory on which to start the application. If no directory is provided, the current directory will be used.

### `next telemetry` options
Next.js collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. Participation in this anonymous program is optional, and you can opt-out if you prefer not to share information.
The following options are available for the `next telemetry` command:
Option| Description  
---|---  
`-h, --help`| Show all available options.  
`--enable`| Enables Next.js' telemetry collection.  
`--disable`| Disables Next.js' telemetry collection.

## Examples
### Changing the default port
By default, Next.js uses `http://localhost:3000` during development and with `next start`. The default port can be changed with the `-p` option, like so:
Terminal
```
next dev-p4000
```

Or using the `PORT` environment variable:
Terminal
```
PORT=4000 next dev
```

> **Good to know** : `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.
### Using HTTPS during development
For certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, you can use HTTPS to have a secure environment on `localhost`. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with `next dev` using the `--experimental-https` flag:
Terminal
```
next dev--experimental-https
```

With the generated certificate, the Next.js development server will exist at `https://localhost:3000`. The default port `3000` is used unless a port is specified with `-p`, `--port`, or `PORT`.
You can also provide a custom certificate and key with `--experimental-https-key` and `--experimental-https-cert`. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with `--experimental-https-ca` as well.
Terminal
```
next dev--experimental-https--experimental-https-key./certificates/localhost-key.pem--experimental-https-cert./certificates/localhost.pem
```

`next dev --experimental-https` is only intended for development and creates a locally trusted certificate with `mkcert`. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities.
> **Good to know** : When deploying to Vercel, HTTPS is automatically configured for your Next.js application.
### Configuring a timeout for downstream proxies
When deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB), it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with keep-alive timeouts that are _larger_ than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated.
To configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass `--keepAliveTimeout` (in milliseconds) to `next start`, like so:
Terminal
```
next start--keepAliveTimeout70000
```

### Passing Node.js arguments
You can pass any node arguments to `next` commands. For example:
Terminal
```
NODE_OPTIONS='--throw-deprecation' next
NODE_OPTIONS='-r esm' next
NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next
```
