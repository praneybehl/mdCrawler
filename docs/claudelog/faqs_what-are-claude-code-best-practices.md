Claude Code best practices are fundamental techniques that maximize AI collaboration efficiency, safety, and output quality. These practices, which I have observed from being a moderator on r/ClaudeAI, make Claude Code significantly more performant and efficient.
### Core Best Practices​
  * **CLAUDE.md Supremacy** - Front-load comprehensive instructions in your `CLAUDE.md` file rather than relying on user prompts. Claude treats `CLAUDE.md` content as immutable system rules with higher adherence than user prompts, ensuring consistent execution and reducing context pollution. Read CLAUDE.md Supremacy →
  * **Plan Mode** - Use `Shift+Tab` twice to activate Plan Mode for safe research and analysis before execution. This separates research from execution, preventing unwanted file modifications while providing structured, consistently formatted responses that improve safety and token efficiency. Read Plan Mode →
  * **Always Be Experimenting** - Embrace the `A.B.E` mindset to continuously push AI boundaries through testing and documentation. The AI revolution requires engineers willing to explore limits, document findings, and share discoveries with the community to unlock transformative potential. Read Always Be Experimenting →
  * **Poison Context Awareness** - Maintain vigilant context hygiene to prevent self-sabotage through contaminated behavioral patterns. Every action pairing creates training patterns that persist throughout sessions, making context discipline as critical as code hygiene for consistent AI collaboration. Read Poison Context Awareness →
  * **You Are the Main Thread** - Maximize productivity by thinking in parallel processes rather than sequential tasks. AI agents multiply your opportunity cost - every idle moment represents wasted parallel processing potential, so queue tasks and delegate operations for maximum throughput.

  * **Task/Agent Tools** - Leverage Claude's `Task` tool for efficient delegation to sub-agents. Explicit orchestration of which steps get delegated to sub-agents yields dramatic speed improvements, similar to multi-threaded programming where clear delegation instructions optimize performance.

##### Continuously Updated
These best practices are continuously updated with new best practices surfaced from the r/ClaudeAI subreddit community. The subreddit community regularly discovers and shares optimization techniques that enhance Claude Code workflows.
