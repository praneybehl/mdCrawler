Building Your ApplicationOptimizingLazy Loading
# Lazy Loading
Lazy loading in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route.
It allows you to defer loading of **Client Components** and imported libraries, and only include them in the client bundle when they're needed. For example, you might want to defer loading a modal until a user clicks to open it.
There are two ways you can implement lazy loading in Next.js:
  1. Using Dynamic Imports with `next/dynamic`
  2. Using `React.lazy()` with Suspense


By default, Server Components are automatically code split, and you can use streaming to progressively send pieces of UI from the server to the client. Lazy loading applies to Client Components.
## `next/dynamic`
`next/dynamic` is a composite of `React.lazy()` and Suspense. It behaves the same way in the `app` and `pages` directories to allow for incremental migration.
## Examples
### Importing Client Components
app/page.js
```
'use client'
import { useState } from'react'
import dynamic from'next/dynamic'
// Client Components:
constComponentA=dynamic(() =>import('../components/A'))
constComponentB=dynamic(() =>import('../components/B'))
constComponentC=dynamic(() =>import('../components/C'), { ssr:false })
exportdefaultfunctionClientComponentExample() {
const [showMore,setShowMore] =useState(false)
return (
  <div>
   {/* Load immediately, but in a separate client bundle */}
   <ComponentA />
   {/* Load on demand, only when/if the condition is met */}
   {showMore && <ComponentB />}
   <buttononClick={() =>setShowMore(!showMore)}>Toggle</button>
   {/* Load only on the client side */}
   <ComponentC />
  </div>
 )
}
```

### Skipping SSR
When using `React.lazy()` and Suspense, Client Components will be prerendered (SSR) by default.
> **Note:** `ssr: false` option will only work for client components, move it into client components ensure the client code-splitting working properly.
If you want to disable pre-rendering for a Client Component, you can use the `ssr` option set to `false`:
```
constComponentC=dynamic(() =>import('../components/C'), { ssr:false })
```

### Importing Server Components
If you dynamically import a Server Component, only the Client Components that are children of the Server Component will be lazy-loaded - not the Server Component itself. It will also help preload the static assets such as CSS when you're using it in Server Components.
app/page.js
```
import dynamic from'next/dynamic'
// Server Component:
constServerComponent=dynamic(() =>import('../components/ServerComponent'))
exportdefaultfunctionServerComponentExample() {
return (
  <div>
   <ServerComponent />
  </div>
 )
}
```

> **Note:** `ssr: false` option is not supported in Server Components. You will see an error if you try to use it in Server Components. `ssr: false` is not allowed with `next/dynamic` in Server Components. Please move it into a client component.
### Loading External Libraries
External libraries can be loaded on demand using the `import()` function. This example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search. The module is only loaded on the client after the user types in the search input.
app/page.js
```
'use client'
import { useState } from'react'
constnames= ['Tim','Joe','Bel','Lee']
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
const [results,setResults] =useState()
return (
  <div>
   <input
type="text"
placeholder="Search"
onChange={async (e) => {
const { value } =e.currentTarget
// Dynamically load fuse.js
constFuse= (awaitimport('fuse.js')).default
constfuse=newFuse(names)
setResults(fuse.search(value))
    }}
   />
   <pre>Results: {JSON.stringify(results,null,2)}</pre>
  </div>
 )
}
```

### Adding a custom loading component
app/page.js
```
'use client'
import dynamic from'next/dynamic'
constWithCustomLoading=dynamic(
 () =>import('../components/WithCustomLoading'),
 {
loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
 }
)
exportdefaultfunctionPage() {
return (
  <div>
   {/* The loading component will be rendered while <WithCustomLoading/> is loading */}
   <WithCustomLoading />
  </div>
 )
}
```

### Importing Named Exports
To dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the Promise returned by `import()` function:
components/hello.js
```
'use client'
exportfunctionHello() {
return <p>Hello!</p>
}
```

app/page.js
```
import dynamic from'next/dynamic'
constClientComponent=dynamic(() =>
import('../components/hello').then((mod) =>mod.Hello)
)
```
